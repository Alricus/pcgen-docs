The Character Sheet Tab allows you to manage characters loaded in GMGen.

![Character Sheet
Tab](../images/gmgen/plugins/charactersheet/gmgen_09_charsheettab.png)

GMGen can alter some elements of a character, most notably experience
points. When the character has been modified an asterisk will appear
beside the characters name indicating that it has been updated and has
not been saved. Clicking the **Save** button will save the current state
of the character. Clicking the **Save As** button will allow you to save
the character under a new file name. Clicking the **Remove** button will
remove the character from all GMGen tabs but will not close the
character from PCGen. Clicking the **Load** button will open a character
in PCGen and GMGen.
