Creating a new character is easy using PCGen. The steps below will guide
you through the process. As you walk your way through this guide you
will note that it does not cover all buttons and fields you see on the
various tabs. What we will cover here is what is necessary to create
your first character. For the purposes of this walkthrough we will be
using the **Pathfinder RPG** GameMode. Using a different gameMode will
present different tabs and sub-tabs as well as many different gamemode
and data set specific game options. Following along with this
walkthrough though will help you understand the basic interface and help
you to find your way through any other gamemode. The data sets loaded
for this walkthrough are:

1.  Paizo - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rules
2.  Paizo - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiary
3.  Paizo - Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's Guide

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Basic Character Options
---------------------------

1.  **Opening Up a New Character**

    Choose the **File&gt;New** menu item to create a new character. You
    may also use the "New" ![New Character](../images/toolbar/new16.png)
    toolbar button just below the menu bar.

    ![File Menu](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_00_file_new.png)

2.  **Starting With the Summary Tab**

    ![Summary Tab](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_01_summary.png)

    A quick review of this tab shows the following areas containing
    related information: **Character Basics** , **Ability Scores** ,
    **Race** , **Class & Level** , and **Things to be Done** areas all
    contain fields for entering various data, some more related
    than others. The first thing we need to do though is to take a quick
    look at the **Things to be Done** pane. Note this area and what it
    currently contains. We'll come back in a bit.

3.  **Entering Ability Scores**

    The first things we're going to do is enter the new character's
    ability scores, and there are a couple of ways to do this.

    The first, and the quickest way to get you started right now is to
    simply enter the ability scopres directly into the avaiable fields,
    which are editable. Click inside each field in turn and, deleting
    the existing number, type the new ability score.

    The second way to enter ability scores into PCGen is to have PCGen
    generate them for you. To do this you first have to set the roll
    method by clicking the **Method** button and selcting which method
    you wish to use. Then you will click the **Roll** button. You can
    click the roll button as often as you desire until you get a set of
    numbers that you like.

4.  **Choosing Your Character's Name**

    Next we'll enter a name for your new character and, as with ability
    scores, there are two ways to enter a name.

    The first, and, again as with ability scores, the method we will use
    here is to simply enter the new characr's name directly into the
    **Name** field. Click on the field and enter your character's name.

    The second method of adding a name is to use PCGen's random
    name generator.

    ![Random Name
    Generator](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_02_name.png)

    Before we call up the random name generator you will need to make
    sure the **Gender** pull-down menu correctly identifies your
    character's gender. Once that is done you will click on the
    **Random** button next to the name field.

    Once the name generator window is up you select the **Category** and
    **Catalog** from which the name will be drawn and then click the
    **Generate** button. A name will appear in the generator's
    **Name** field. If you do not like the name that cmes up simply
    click the **Generate** button until one shows up that you like and
    then click **Ok** .

    PCGen's random name generator has a good selection of names, of both
    fantasy and historical origin.

    Once you've entered a character name you might as well enter names
    into the **Player** and **Tab Label** fields. The tab label is used
    if you wish the tab for your character to be designated with
    something other than your character's name.

    Before we move to the next step take a look at the **Things to be
    Done** pane. . . . Did you notice that "Enter a Name" is now
    missing? This is one of the most useful blocks of information on the
    **Summary Tab** when creating a character. Remember it.

5.  **Selecting a Race**

    Now we move to selecting a race.

    The quickest way to select a race is to do so from the **Race**
    pull-down menu on the **Summary Tab** . The races on this menu are
    listed with the **PC** races first to simplify your selection. To
    select a race you pull-down to the desired race and let go of
    the menu. The race will automatically be selected after clicking in
    any other data field. upon triggering the selection any racial
    bonuses to the ability scores will automatically be added.

    There is, of course, another way to select a race and this is on the
    **Race Tab** .

6.  **Selecting a Race, The Race Tab**

    ![Selecting a Race](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_03_race.png)

    Selecting a race on the **Race Tab** is a little more difficult than
    the quick method but is still fairly simple. The left pane lists all
    races contained in the currently loaded data sets and if the data
    sets include bestiaries this list can get very long. Its fortunate
    then that the **Race Tab** has, as most of tabs, a
    **Search** function.

    ![Searching for a
    Race](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_04_search.png)

    Enter the name of the race you are interested in. Note that as you
    type the name in the list of races begins to change. PCGen does its
    search actively as you type, saving time for you, the user. Once the
    character race that you are looking for appears you click on the
    **Select Race &gt;** button and the selected race will be placed in
    the right pane.

7.  **Back to the Summary Tab and Selecting Bonus Languages**

    Moving back to the **Summary Tab** , take a look at the **Things to
    be Done** pane. If your new character has a high enough intelligence
    you will see the message "Select Bonus Languages". If not, feel free
    to jump to the next step.

    Just above the **Things to be Done** pane you wll find the
    **Languages** pane. Click on the "Add Bonus Language" **+** button.

    ![Selecting a Bonus
    Language](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_05_language.png)

    You can find how many bonus language slots you have available by
    looking above the right pane. To select a bonus language you click
    on the desired language in the left pane and then click on the **Add
    Language &gt;** button. This will move the selected language to the
    right pane and reduce the avialable language slots by one.

    Repeat this process until you are out of bonus language slots.

    Its time to once again take a look and see what's next on our list
    of **Things to be Done** .

8.  **Selecting a Class**

    Now, at last, its time to select your new characters Class!

    As with race selection, there are two ways to select a class. We
    will start with the quick method.

    ![Available Classes](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_06_class.png)

    Clicking on the **Class** drop-down menu in the **Class & Level**
    section of the **Summary Tab** presents a list of available classes.
    Scroll through the list and select the desired class. You will note
    that some of these classes appear in red text. This is an indication
    that the classes have inherent prerequisites that your new character
    does not meet. If the restricted class is a base PC class it will
    likely have an alignment requirement so if you have not selected an
    alignment yet you can do so at this time by clicking on the
    **Alignment** drop-down located on the left side of the **Summary
    Tab** above the **Language** pane.

    Once you've selected an alignment you can go back to the **Class**
    drop-down and select a class for your character. After selecting the
    class you will make sure that the **Add Levels** text field has a
    "1" in it and then click on the **+** button. You will next see this
    warning:

    ![Ability Score
    Warning](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_07_warning.png)

    It is important to note that many gameModes lock in the intelligence
    score bonus at 1st level so before you select your first class level
    you ant to make sure that your ability scores are acceptable. In the
    case of the sample character, as he is human and we are using the
    Pathfinder gameMode, he gets to select an ability score bonus. So
    we'll click the **No** button and then take detour from **Class**
    selection and take a look at the **Feats & Abilities Tab** . to do
    this click on the **Ability Bonus Remain to be Selected** in the
    **Things to be Done** pane. (Ah ha! a new bit of usability for the
    PCGen GUI! Thats right! The items in this pane are hot links to the
    tab where the relevant selections are to be made!)

9.  **Selecting the Human's Ability Score Bonus**

    ![Ability Score
    Bonus](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_08_abilities.png)

    You will note that PCGen has changed to the **Feats & Abilities
    Tab** and activated the **Racial Abilities Sub-Tab** . The available
    ability bonuses are displayed in the left pane while the right pane
    displays the ability categories **Ability Bonus** and **Human Racial
    Traits** . If you click on the **Human Racial Traits** in the right
    pane the abilities listed in the left pane change. These abilities
    are the "Human Racial Traits" that the character has. For now you
    can ignore these. Click on the **Ability Bonus** entry in the right
    pane and the original abilities bonuses reappear in the left pane.
    Looking at the lower-left pane you will see the same two
    ability categories. You will also see a set of two numbers, one pair
    for each ability category. The first number represents the number of
    abilities of that category available to the character and the second
    number is the number of ability selections left. For our human you
    can see tht he has one ability bonus granted and that he has that
    one still to select. So the next thing we do is select one.

    This is accomplished by clicking on the ability bonus desired and
    then clicking on the **Add Selected &gt;** button and the selected
    ability bonus appears in the right pane beneath the **Ability
    Bonus** category.

    ![Selected Ability Score
    Bonus](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_09_selected.png)

    It's time to return to the **Summary Tab** and the selection of a
    class for our new character.

10. **Class Selection, Again**

    Move back to the **Summary Tab** by clicking on its tab just below
    the **Toolbar** . Once there click on the **Class** drop-down menu
    and select the desired class. When the warning dialog appears click
    the **Yes** button. Next a dialog box will pop up, asking you to
    select a free set of clothing.

    ![Selected a Free Set of
    Clothing](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_10_clothing.png)

    Scroll through the list of clothing and select the desired set. Then
    click on the **Add** button and then the **Close** button.

    ![The Character's First
    Level](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_11_leveling.png)

    The next dialog that pops up shows the class taken, the hit points
    gained, the hit points rolled, and the skill points granted. Click
    the **Close** button and the window will close.

11. **A Few Notes on the **Things to be Done** Pane**

    This is as good a time as any to go over a few things concerning the
    **Things to be Done** pane.

    a.  As stated before the items listed in this pane are **Hot Links**
        that will take you to the tab/sub-tab where the relevant
        selections are to be made. If the selection to be made is
        located on the **Summary Tab** , PCgen will highlight the
        relevant pane on the **Summary Tab** .
    b.  These items are **NOT** listed in the order of priority. They
        can be taken care of in any order desired. Of course there are
        some options that will be taken that might benefit from other
        options, but with the shear number of options available variety
        of effects, there really is no way to definitively determine
        which item should be handled before any other.

12. **The Next Step**

    Reviewing the items listed in the **Things to be Done** pane I am
    going to jump to the **Favored Class remain to be selected** item.
    As before, click on the item. What follows is a sequence of views in
    which the **Favored Class** and subsequent options are selected.
    Note the progression of "Total" and "Remaining" selections in the
    lower-left pane.

    ![Favored Class
    Selection](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_12_favoredclass.png)

    In the **Pathfinder RPG** gamemode a character receives a bonus each
    time he takes a level in his **Favored Class** . So we will scroll
    through the list of classes and double-click the new character's
    **Favored Class** .

    ![Favored Bonus
    Selection](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_13_favoredbonus.png)

    For this option the **Qualified** button has been activated to
    remove the ineligible options. What is left are three bonuses.
    Double-click the character's desired bonus.

    ![Favored Bonus Spell
    Selection](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_14_bonusspell.png)

    This is the deepest this particular class' **Favored Class** bonuses
    go so we will now return to the **Summary Tab** and to the
    **Skill** selections.

13. **The Skills the Thing**

    Back on the **Summary Tab** we look once again at the **Things to be
    Done** pane and the next thing on the list is **Skill points remain
    to be spent** . Click on the **Hot Link** and we'll zip right over
    to the **Skills Tab** .

    ![Skill Selection](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_15_skills.png)

    Your new character will have a number of skill points to spend, a
    number dependent on the class selected and the character's
    intelligence bonus. The number of points available can be found in
    the lower-left pane where, as in the **Feats & Abilities Tab** , you
    will find the skill points "Gained" and "Remaining" listed by level.
    You can take spend one skill point per skill rank with a limit of
    one point per level taken. To spend a skill point you will find the
    skill you wish to spend the point on and then click the up "Arrow".
    Note that each class has skills that are considered "Class" skills
    with the rest being "Non-class" skills. In the **Pathfinder RPG**
    gameMode the cost of skills are the same whether class or non-class
    while the **3.5e** gamemode the class skills cost one point and the
    non-class skills cost two points.

    After spending all available skill points we can go back to the
    **Summary Tab** .

14. **The Feats the Thing**

    Back on the **Summary Tab** we look once again at the **Things to be
    Done** pane and the next item on the list is **Feat remain to be
    selected** . Click on the **Hot Link** and we'll zip back to the
    **Feats & Abilities Tab** .

    ![Feat Selection](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_16_feats.png)

    This is our third trip to the **Feats & Abilities Tab** so you
    should be familiar with what you'll see here. The lower-left pane
    shows that the character has a total of 2 feats selections available
    with only one left to make. Review of the right pane shows there are
    htree feats appearing in yellow text. These are feats that have been
    added automatically. these are generally added as class or
    racial features. **Arane Stike** is included in black text and
    represens the first of two feat selections. Pick your desired feats
    and double-click on them to add them to the character.

    Now that the feats have been selected and added to your character
    lets go back to the **Summary Tab** .

15. **Trait Selection . . . or Not**

    Examining the **Things to be Done** pane shows us two items left;
    **Traits** and **Spells** . Though not unique to the **Pathfinder**
    setting, traits are not common in the other gameModes distributed by
    PCGen and even in the Pathfinder setting they are optional. PCGen is
    preset to grant PC's 2 trait points but if you set out create an NPC
    PCGen will not grant these points. Click on **Traits remain to be
    Selected** and we'll go over how we add traits, or opt out of
    using traits.

    ![Trait Selection](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_17_traits.png)

    You will note that we are back to the **Feats & Abilities Tab** so
    you should be familiar with how to add your selections to
    your character. As noted above, traits are optional. If you choose
    not to use traits you simply find the **No Traits** item and add it
    to your character. If you wish to use traits, feel free to scroll
    though the list and pick those of interest and add them to
    your character. Remember that you can use activate the **Qualified**
    button to shorten the list. Also be aware that as you make
    selections some traits will become unavailable. Clicking once on a
    trait will present the description and benefits in the lower-right
    pane so yu can browse through them prior to making your
    final selections.

    Once you have made your final selection navigate back to the
    **Summary Tab** .

16. **Spells, Spells, and More Spells**

    The last item listed in the **Things to be Done** pane is **Spell
    remain to be selected** . Click on the hot link and off we go for a
    spell!

    ![Known Spell](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_18_knownspells.png)

    On the **Spell Tab** you will note that there are three sub-tabs,
    the **Known Spells** , the **Prepared Spells** , and the **Spell
    Books** sub-tabs. We will look at the **Known Spells**
    sub-tab first.

    a.  **Known Spells Sub-Tab**

        The **Known Spells** sub-tab (shown above) has four panes. The
        upper-left pane will display the spells available to the
        character, based upon the data sets loaded. The upper-right pane
        is where the characters known spells will be displayed. The
        lower-right pane displays a table that identifies the number of
        spells known, for spellcasters that do not use spellbooks, and
        the number of spells castable per day for the character. The
        lower-left pane will display the spell information for the spell
        selected by clicking on it in either the left or right
        upper panes.

        To add a spell to the list of **Known Spells** you select the
        desired spell in the left pane and then click the
        **&gt;** button. The desired spell will be added to the
        right pane. Note that spellcasters that do not have to memorize
        spells will only be allowed to add as many spells as is
        indicated in the lower-right pane as "Known" by spell level.

    b.  **Prepared Spells Sub-Tab**

        ![Prepared
        Spells](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_19_preparedspells.png)

        The **Prepared Spells** sub-tab has four panes and is useful
        only to those spellcasters that must memorize or pray
        for spells. The upper-left pane will display the spells known by
        the character. The upper-right pane is where the character's
        prepared spells will be displayed. The lower-right pane displays
        a table that identifies the number of spells castable per day
        for the character. The lower-left pane will display the spell
        information for the spell selected by clicking on it in either
        the left or right upper panes.

        To add a spell to the list of **Prepared Spells** you select the
        desired spell in the left pane and then click the
        **&gt;** button. The desired spell will be added to the
        right pane. Note that spellcasters that memorize spells will
        only be allowed to add as many spells as is indicated in the
        lower-right pane as can be "Cast" by spell level.

    c.  **Spells Books Sub-Tab**

        ![Spell
        Books](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_20_spellbooks.png)

        The **Spellbooks** sub-tab has four panes and is useful only to
        spellcasters that use spellbooks. The upper-left pane will
        display the spells available to the character. The upper-right
        pane is where the character's spellbooks, and the spells
        contained within, are displayed. The lower-right pane displays a
        table that identifies the number of spells castable per day for
        the character, and the lower-left pane will display the spell
        information for the spell selected by clicking on it in either
        the left or right upper panes.

        To add a spell to a **Spellbook** you click on the target
        spellbook in the right-pane and then select the desired spell in
        the left pane and then clicking the **&gt;** button. The desired
        spell will be added to the target spellbooke. The number of
        spells that can be placed in a spellbook is limited by the nu
        ber of pages in the book. Specifically, each spell will take up
        a number of pages equal to one page per spell-level, with a
        minimum of one page. Spellbooks generally contain no more than
        one-hundred pages but there is no limit to the number of
        spellbooks a spellcaster can have.

    We are done with the spells so ws now move back to the **Summary
    Tab** and examine the **Things to be Done** pane you will note that
    we are done. There are no items left to take care of! . . . Ok, its
    not quite that easy.

17. **We're Done! Uh, I Don't Think So . . .**

    Though the **Things to be Done** pane is now empty there are a
    number of tabs left that we have yet visit. For some of these there
    is nothing on them for the character I've been working on, but
    mostly bacause they are player driven and not so much because the
    character choices take you there as is the case with the tabs we
    have visted so far. These tabs will be covered in the next section.

18. **Domain Tab**

    There are classes that can be selected that, as a class feature, are
    granted access to divine powers through specific **Domains** . When
    such a class is taken the **Things to be Done** pane on the
    **Summary Tab** will include a link to this tab.

    ![Spell Books](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_21_domain.png)

    Like many of the other tabs, the **Domains Tab** is separated into
    four panes.The upper-left pane lists all deities available in the
    loaded data sets. The upper-right pane will remain empty until a
    deity is selected, and ten it will list the **Domains** which the
    selected Deity can grant to their clerics. The lower panes will
    display the descriptions of the deity and domain seected in the
    panes above them.

    To select a domain you must first selcet a **Deity** from the
    left pane. You will then select the desired domain(s) from the
    right pane. The PCGen team has included a deity named **None** for
    those who do not wish to restrict their domain choices by the
    deity choosen. Selecting **None** will make all base
    domains available. Continue selecting domains untl all available
    slots are taken.

19. **Companions Tab**

    A number of classes grant "Companions" to the character that takes
    those classes. Whether it is the Paladin's **Special Mount** , the
    Wizards **Familiar** , or the Druids **Animal Companion** . If you
    have taken one of these classes, or any of the other classes that
    grant a Companion, you will need to visit the **Companion Tab** .

    ![Companion
    Tab](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_22_companions.png)

    The **Companions Tab** is separated into two panes. The left pane
    lists the different categories of "Companions" tha are available to
    your character. Next to each category is a pair of numbers within a
    set of parenthesis. The first number is the number of that type f
    comapnion that the current character has and the second number shows
    how many are allowed to the current character. Note that simple
    Mounts and Followers have no limit within PCGen. The sample
    character currently has no Familiar but is allowed one. To begin the
    process of adding a Familiar, all we need to do is click on the
    companion type and then on the **Creae New** button. The following
    window pops up.

    ![Companion
    Selection](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_23_companionselect.png)

    The **Select a Race** window presents a list of races to choose your
    companion from. In this case, the race of the character's familiar.
    Select the desired race and click on the **Create &lt;Companion
    Type&gt;** button. In this case it will be the **Create
    Familiar** button. Once this button has been clicked the next window
    will pop up, though the **Select a Race** window will remain open.

    ![Companion
    Level](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_24_companionlevel.png)

    The next window to pop up and displays the new companion's class,
    gained hit points, rolled hit points, and skill points granted to
    the new companion.

    ![Companion Language
    Selection](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_25_companionlanguage.png)

    Some companions have additional selection to be made, thus the
    Raven, taken as a familiar, will be granted a free language. Make te
    appropriat selections and move on.

    ![Companion
    Info](../images/walkthrough/walkthrough_26_companioninfo.png)

    Finally, the new companion's basic information will appear in the
    right pane of the **Companions Tab** . Note that the new companion
    also has its own **Main Tab** with the label "Unnamed". At this
    point you can move to the companions tab and follow the links on the
    **Things to be Done** pane on the **Summary Tab** .

    This completes the walkthough of the steps driven by **Character
    Options** . The next section covers those tabs and character
    creation steps driven by **Character Play** options.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Player Driven Options
-------------------------

1.  **Inventory Tab**

    Your character will need weapons, armor, and all manner of other
    gear and PCGen can help you here as well. For detailed information
    on how to **[purchase](/tab/inventory.html#purchase)** and
    **[equip](/tab/inventory.html#equipment)** all equipment you can
    visit the **[Inventory Tab](/tab/inventory.html)** documentation.

2.  **Temporary Tab**

    PCGen automatically calculates all static and modifiers required for
    your character, including AC, To Hit numbers, weapon damage
    modifiers, saving thows modifiers, etc. PCGen can also track
    temporary bonuses but applying those to the character is more
    problematic, especially taking the "conditional" nature of
    such bonuses. For detailed information on how you can apply
    temporary/conditional bonuses to your character you can visit the
    **[Temporary Bonuses Tab](/tab/temporary-bonuses.html)**
    documentation and the **[Character Sheet
    Tab](/tab/character-sheet.html)** documentation.

3.  **Description Tab**

    For detailed information on what additional indormation can be
    stored along with your character, including character description,
    character portrait, and campaign history, you can visit the
    **[Description Tab](/tab/description.html)** . documentation

4.  **Character Sheet Tab**

    Finally, once all character options have been decides, special
    companions found, descriptions written, bonuses applied, and
    histories written, the only thing left is to print your character.
    PCGen has an extensive collection of output templates, but before
    you print it out, you just might want to preview it. To do that you
    need to look to the **Character Sheet Tab** . For detailed
    information on how to select any of the provided templates as well
    as to pring your character you can visit the **[Character Sheet
    Tab](/tab/character-sheet.html)** documentation and the **[File Menu
    Options](/menu/file/file_index.html)** documentation.
