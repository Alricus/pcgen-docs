1.  When PCGen starts up it displays the PCGen splash screen.

    After it automatically disappears, you will see the PCGen program
    window and will be on the **Source Materials** tab. \[Tabs for the
    Source Material and Loaded Characters default to the bottom of the
    screen.\]

2.  First you should choose your desired Game Mode.

    As of now PCGen supports the following Game Modes:

    -   3.5e - [Revised (v.3.5) System Reference
        Document](http://www.wizards.com/D20/article.asp?x=srd35)
        (default selection).
    -   3e - [System
        Reference Document.](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/files/3.0%20SRD/)
    -   Deadlands - [by Pinnacle
        Entertainment](http://www.peginc.com/index.htm)
    -   Legends of Excalibur - [by RPG
        Objects](http://www.rpgobjects.com/)
    -   Modern - [d20 Modern System
        Reference Document.](http://www.wizards.com/D20/article.asp?x=msrd)
    -   Spycraft - [by Alderac
        Entertainment Group.](http://www.spycraftrpg.com/)
    -   Xcrawl - [by Pandahead Productions](http://www.pandahead.com/)
    -   Sidewinder - [by Dog House Rules](http://www.doghouserules.net/)

    ![Choosing Gamemode](../images/menus/settings_gamemode.png)

3.  Now you can load sources appropriate to your chosen
    Game Mode/Campaign.

    The Window is broken into 4 panes. The sources **Available** to be
    used with PCGen, the sources you have **Selected** for use in
    Character Generation, the **Source Info** pane and the button pane.

    ![Loading Campaing Materials](../images/tabs/sourcematerial.png)

    If you have never started PCGen before, the right hand **Selected**
    pane will be empty.

    The upper-left **Available** frame is a tree of publishers.\
     Clicking the "+" sign next to a publisher will expand the tree and
    show the subgroups for that publisher.

4.  When you select a source of interest, the information about the
    source appears in the lower left **Source Info** frame.

    Click the **Add** ("&gt;") button at the top of the upper left frame
    to add the selected source to the **Selected** pane. You can also
    double-click the source to add it. You can also add all sources from
    a company or setting by selecting the company/setting instead of the
    product and then clicking the **Add** button or double clicking
    the company/setting.

    If, for instance, you wanted to create a character for the System
    Reference Document , you would expand the "SRD", and select the
    "3.0 SRD".

    Do this for every source you need to build your character.

    **Note:** If the character you want to build requires information
    other than that found in the core player's book, (i.e. it comes from
    a specific campaign world, has a prestige class from a supplemental
    book, or equipment from a magazine article) you will need to load
    the source which has this information.

5.  Once all the sources you need are in the upper right **Selected**
    pane, click the **Load** button in the lower right frame. This will
    load all sources in the upper right **Selected** pane.

    The Loaded column in the **Selected** pane will then change to "Y"

    Various pop ups may come up detailing some licensing information and
    publisher information, just close those (you can also uncheck the
    "show at start up" option, so that it only runs once).

6.  You may now create your new character.

**Optional:** Before creating a character, you may wish to examine
and/or modify the settings PCGen uses for all characters. This allows
certaincommon "house rules" to override official rules for a system.
This can be found under the
[**Settings-Preferences**](/menu/settings/preferences.html) menu.
