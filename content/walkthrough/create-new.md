1.  Choose the **File&gt;New** menu item to create a new character, or
    **File&gt;Open** button to load a previously created character. You
    may also use the "New" ![New character](../images/toolbar/new16.png)
    and "Open" ![Open Character](../images/toolbar/open16.png) toolbar
    buttons just below the menu bar.

    ![File Menu](../images/menus/file/menu_file_0.png)

2.  PCGen will open a new character tab and display the **Summary**
    character creation tab.

    ![Summary Tab](../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_00.png)

    This tab contains a number of basic fields such as **Name** ,
    **Alignment** , **Race** , and **Class** . This tab also includes
    fields for your character's **Ability Scores** .

    Enter your ability scores in the **Score \[Editable\]** field.

    You should also enter a character name and player name at this time,
    and you must select an alignment for your character in order to
    select a class later.

    You can enter a Tab Label if you wish the tab for your character to
    be designated with something other than your character's name.

    If you click on the **Random** button, the **Random Name Generator**
    will appear. Select the **ruleset** (Name Type) from the left pane
    and then click the **Generate Name** button. A random name will
    appear in the right hand pane. Keep clicking the **Generate Name**
    button until you are happy with the name and then click the
    **Accept** button to return it to the **Summary** character
    creation tab.

    ![Random Name
    Generator](../images/tabs/summarytab/tab_summary_02_name.png)

3.  Select the **Race** character creation tab.

    ![race.png](../images/tabs/race.png)

    This screen is divided into two sub-tabs, **Races** and
    **Templates** . The **Races** ab display the available Races the
    character can belong to. The **Templates** tab display the available
    templates that can be added to the character. You can apply
    templates to your character at any time.

    \
     When you select a race by clicking a race in the top frame of the
    Races sub-tab, information about the race is displayed in the lower
    frame of the Races sub-tab.\
    \
     Once you have chosen the race for your character, click the
    **Select** button or double-click the desired race name. \[You could
    also have selected a race on the Summary tab\]\
    \
     **Note:** You must select an alignment on the summary tab before
    choosing a race.\
    \

4.  Select the **Class** character creation tab.\

    ![class.png](../images/tabs/class.png)

    \
    \
     In the upper left frame you will see a list of classes available
    for use. \[Some of these may be red, indicating that you do not
    qualify for them.\]\
    \
     Now click a class. You will again notice that information about the
    class is displayed, this time in the lower left frame. \[If you do
    not qualify for a class, the reason your character doesn't qualify
    for a class is indicated in red on the class description.\]\
    \
     Either click the **Add** ("&gt;") button or double-click a class to
    add a level of it.\
    \
     The level appears in the upper right frame.\
    \
     With your first class level, you will be asked to select a set of
    clothing (which you get for free), and may be asked to make other
    selections if the class includes any.\
    \
     **Note:** When making a choice (or choices) from a pop-up dialog,
    you will see how many choices you have remaining at the bottom of
    the popup.\
    \
     Click an item of interest from the upper frame, and click the "Add"
    button to add it to the lower frame of the dialog and decrement your
    number of choices by one. (You may also double-click an item in the
    upper dialog to add it to the lower frame.) You may then continue to
    make choices if you have some left (such as for feats that can be
    taken multiple times), or you can Close the dialog saving some
    choices for later.\

    ![feat\_choice.png](../images/windows/feat_choice.png)

    \
    \
     Once you have added your first class level you will notice that the
    information in the lower right frame has changed. It now tells you
    how many Hit Points your character has, how many skill and feat
    selections it has remaining, what your base attack bonus is, and
    what your saving throw values are.\
    \
     You can adjust your Hit Point total by clicking the **HP** button
    as per the summary page. All characters gain maximum hit points at
    first level, but thereafter you will need to tell PCGen how many hit
    points you gained with each level increase.\

    ![adjust\_hitpoints.png](../images/windows/adjust_hitpoints.png)

    \
     You can also add your **Experience** total and **Next Level**
    amount so it can print on the character sheet. This is done by
    clicking on the **Adj XP** button.\

    ![adjust\_xp.png](../images/windows/adjust_xp.png)

    \
    \

5.  Select the **Skills** character creation tab.\

    ![skills.png](../images/tabs/skills.png)

    \
    \
     This is where you can add ranks in skills.\
    \
     The skill names appear in the upper left frame, their descriptions
    appear in the lower left frame, the skills you have added appear in
    the upper right frame, and you add skills by selecting them and
    clicking **Add** ("&gt;") or by double-clicking the skill or by
    clicking on the "+" button.\
    \
     If you change your mind about a skill, you can remove a rank in the
    skill by clicking the skill in the upper right frame and clicking
    the **Remove** ("&lt;") button or double clicking the skill in the
    right hand frame or clicking on the "-" button. You may also
    right-click a skill in the upper-right frame to add or remove ranks
    from that skill.\
    \
     The number of skill points you have left to spend is shown in the
    lower right frame.\
    \
     If your character has more than one class, you will need to select
    which class you will purchase your skills as and then purchase them
    as listed above.\
    \
     There are a few other useful options for adding skill points that
    are accessed by right-clicking a skill and using the popup menu. One
    of these is to assign the skill the maximum possible ranks.\
    \

6.  Select the **Feats** character creation tab.\
    \
     **Note:** The Feats Tab now has a Salient Divine Abilities sub-tab
    where you can select Divine abilities when you have extremely high
    level characters.

    ![feats.png](../images/tabs/feats.png)

    \
    \
     Feats appear and are selected just as classes and skills are.\
    \
     Feats you do not qualify for are listed in red.\
    \

7.  Select the **Domains** character creation tab.\

    ![domains.png](../images/tabs/domains.png)

    \
    \
     Here you can enter a deity for your character to worship if desired
    and choose clerical domains if your character is a priest.\
    \
     To create a deity, select the "None" deity and right-click on it,
    you can then select **Create New Deity** . You should enter a name,
    favored weapon, domains, and allowed worshipper alignments for your
    deity as a bare minimum. Other information is useful but not
    absolutely essential to creating your character. Once you have
    entered all the desired information, click the **Save** button on
    the deity editor.\
    \
     **Note:** More detailed information on deity creation is available
    in the Deity List Editor section of this Guide.\
    \
     If your character is a Priest, you will be able to select domains
    after choosing the deity. Select your domains from the upper right
    frame by highlighting them and clicking Select, or by
    double-clicking.\
    \
     **Note:** The deity "None" allows the selection of any two
    domains.\
    \

8.  If your character is a spellcaster, select the **Spells** character
    creation tab. The Spells Tab is divided into three sub-tabs: Known
    Spells, Prepared Spells and Spell Books.\

    ![spells\_known.png](../images/tabs/spells_known.png)

    \
    \
     On the Known Spells sub-tab the left frame contains a complete list
    of spells for each spellcasting class you possess. The right frame
    displays spells you "know" (the ones your deity grants, the ones you
    know due to class, or the ones in your spell book, as applicable)
    and are able to cast.\
    \
     If your spellcasting class has a list from which the character can
    prepare without a spell book, all spells on the class list will be
    included in the Known Spells "spellbook" if the check box - *"add
    auto known spells on level/load"* is checked.\
    \
     If your spellcasting class has a number of spells the character
    knows and can cast without preparation, you may choose these from
    the upper left frame (info on each spell is displayed in the lower
    left frame when it is selected) and use **Add** ("&gt;") or
    double-click them to add them to the upper right frame into the
    Known Spells "spellbook".\
    \
     Information on the selected spellcasting class from the upper left
    frame is displayed in the lower right frame.\
    \
     If your spellcasting class uses a spellbook to store spells which
    you prepare daily, you can add spells to it in the same fashion.
    Once you have added the spells you "know" you can switch to the
    Spell Books sub-tab to record which of your known spells are in
    which books.\
    \
     To indicate which spells you have prepared (for those classes which
    prepare spells), (i.e. different sets depending on if you're in the
    city or in a dungeon) switch to the Prepared Spells sub-tab to
    create your prepared spell lists.\
    \

    ![prepared.png](../images/tabs/spells_prepared.png)

    \
     you can create Spell Lists by typing a name in the Spell List text
    box and clicking on the **Add** button. Next, select it in the Right
    Hand Frame. When you do this, the left hand frame will change to the
    listing of your Known Spells and you will now be drawing from that
    list to populate the list of prepared spells. Additionally, if you
    are a divine spellcaster with domains, you will be allowed to
    prepare one of your domain spells specifically.\
    \
     **Warning:** PCGen will allow you to add lower level spells into
    higher level slots (per the rules) but this will prevent you from
    adding you full compliment of spells in those higher slots if a
    lower level spell is in its place. An easy way to avoid this is to
    add your highest level spells first and work your way down.\
    \

    ![spellbooks.png](../images/tabs/spellbooks.png)

    \
     If your class uses a Spellbook to record spells in you can use the
    Spell Books sub-tab to track your spellbooks. First you will need to
    add one of these items to your inventory. The
    Spellbook (Wizard's/Blank) and the Blessed Book items are
    specifically set up for this purpose, when either item is added to
    your PC's list of equipment they will also appear on the Spell
    Books sub-tab. It is suggested that you customize the
    Spellbook (Wizard's/Blank) item to give it a unique name (such as
    "Merlin's Spellbook Vol 1") making it easier to keep track of. Once
    you have a spellbook in your inventory you can add your known spells
    to it, each spell will take the proper number of pages according to
    the rules making it easy to know when it's time to buy another
    spellbook.\
    \

9.  Select the **Inventory** character creation tab and then the
    **Gear** sub-tab.\

    ![inventory\_gear.png](../images/tabs/inventory_gear.png)

    \
    \
     Here you can purchase items, set up different equipment sets and
    add resources (familiars and the like).\
    \
     You can purchase items in the same way you purchase skills, as you
    purchase items you will see the amount of money you have available
    in the lower right frame diminish.\
    \
     You can modify this total by editing the "Gold:" field.\
    \

10. In some cases you will need to customize an item before it can be
    used by your character. If your character is not Medium sized you
    will need to create custom Armor to fit that size. If you are in 3.5
    mode you will also need to create custom weapons sized for
    your character. The customizer also allows you to create Masterwork,
    Magical and other special items. To create a custom item select it
    in the main gear list and right click it, then choose "Create custom
    item" from the pop up list. The customizer will appear:\
    \

    ![customeizer.png](../images/windows/customizer.png)

    You can change the size of the item from the size pop up menu in the
    lower left side of the window. You can change the name and other
    properties of the item with the buttons next to it. Add special
    properties to the item by selecting them from the list on the left.
    When you are finished click Buy and the item will be added to your
    gear list. Customized items also appear in the main gear list for
    any character to select.\
    \

11. Once you have selected the items your character owns on the **Gear**
    sub-tab, select the **Equipping** sub-tab.\

    ![inventory\_equipping.png](../images/tabs/inventory_equipping.png)

    \
    \
     Here you will allocate what items are equipped or stored.\
    \
     Select locations for the items your character owns on the upper
    right frame.\
    \
     Some items are containers and can hold other items.\
    \
     Every item your character is carrying should be marked "Carried" so
    your encumbrance will be figured correctly.\
    \
     Armors, weapons, shields, and magical items need to be marked as
    "Equipped" so that PCGen gives you the appropriate benefit for
    using them. Weapons that are carried will appear on the character
    sheet in the weapons section.\
    \
     You can add additional equipment sets by typing in the name of an
    equipment set and clicking on the Add button (in the Upper right
    hand frame).\
    \
     You can then select equipment from the left hand frame (this
    contains what you bought in the gear tab) into the equipment sets
    you chose (e.g. Dungeon, City etc). You can do this by selecting an
    item and double clicking on it or clicking on the **Add** ("&gt;")
    button.\
    \

12. Once you have equipped the items your character owns on the
    **Equipping** sub-tab, select the **Resources** sub-tab.\

    ![inventory\_resources.png](../images/tabs/inventory_resources.png)

    \
    \
     You must save your character before proceeding.\
    \
     You can then select the type of resource you'd like to add to your
    character on the Right hand frame (Animal Companion, Familiar,
    Follower or Special Mount). You can then double click on the
    resource in the left hand frame to add that resource as a particular
    type or click on the **Add** ("&gt;") button.\
    \
     If you already have an existing character saved that you wish to
    use as a resource for another you can double click the resource type
    in the right pane and a dialog window will open allowing you to
    select a .pcg file to use as that resource.\
    \
     **Note:** For familiars, animal companions and special mounts to
    show up, your character has to be of a class that allows those
    resources (e.g. Wizard for a familiar, Druid or Ranger for animal
    companions and a Paladin for a special Mount).\
    \
     You will be asked to enter the name of the resource and then the
    resource will be saved a as a separate character.\

    ![follower\_name.png](../images/windows/follower_name.png)

    \
    \
     You will then be asked for the save location of the followers PCGen
    file.\

    ![save\_slayer.png](../images/windows/save_slayer.png)

    \
    \
     PCGen will then prompt you for hit points for its monster levels
    (if applicable).\

    ![follower\_hitpoints.png](../images/windows/follower_hitpoints.png)

    \
    \
     It will then swap you to that new character and you can flesh them
    out as required.\

    ![follower\_saving.png](../images/windows/follower_saving.png)

    \
    \
     You can then save that new resource and go back the resource tab on
    the original character. You should then see the new resource added
    under the resource type in the right hand frame.\

    ![follower.png](../images/windows/follower.png)

    \
    \

13. Next go to the **Temporary Bonuses** sub-tab.\

    ![onventory\_temporary
    bonuses.png](../images/tabs/inventory_temporarybonuses.png)

    \

    The **Temporary Bonus** Sub-Tab can be used to apply conditional
    bonuses to your character such as Spell effects, bonuses due to
    Rage, having a familiar within 5 feet of your character and more.
    These bonuses are situational and are useful to see how they would
    effect your characters stats. Rage, for example, has a number of
    bonuses and penalties associated with it and this provides a
    convenient way to apply them in one step. You can then output a
    separate sheet for when you character in enraged.

    Some Temporary Bonuses like Rage are only available to those
    characters who have acquired the ability. There are many Temporary
    Bonuses which are available to any character when the situation
    calls for it. There are conditional templates such as Fatigued
    and Exhausted. Many spell effects are available this way because
    they can be cast on characters by other characters and thus you
    would not need to have the spell on your spell list to benefit
    from it. The craft skill and some others have penalties which can be
    applied if your character does not have the correct tools for
    the job.

    Apply any Temporary bonuses you want by selecting the bonus and
    clicking Apply Bonus. Certain Temporary Bonuses have to be applied
    to weapons or other equipment, when you select that type of bonus a
    list of qualifying equipment your character possesses will be
    displayed in the right side pane of the tab.

14. Now go back to the **Summary** character creation tab and click the
    "Lang, Weap Prof & SA" button.\

    ![summary\_buttons.png](../images/tabs/summary_buttons.png)

    \
    \
     If you click the **Lang, Weap Prof & SA** button, the **Lang, Weap
    Prof & SA** window appears. This is where you can select the
    starting **languages** , **special abilities** and **weapon
    proficiencies** that your PC has. It is also where the languages
    from skills can be selected.\

    ![abilities.png](../images/windows/abilities.png)

    \
    \
     **Languages** - You can select the additional languages your
    character knows due to spent skill ranks ("Skill") or high ability
    scores ("Other") now, by clicking the relevant button and selecting
    them.\

    ![Choose\_language.png](../images/windows/choose_language.png)

    \
    \
     **Special Abilities** - This currently shows any special abilities
    granted by your character's race. As you gain levels in classes, the
    names of special abilities granted by the classes will show up here.
    You can also add and remove your own Special abilities at will.\

    ![add\_sa.png](../images/windows/add_sa.png)

    \
    \
     **Weapon Profs** - This shows all the weapon proficiencies
    you have. If your race or class grants you weapon proficiency, click
    "Optional Profs" to select it here.\

    ![choose\_weaponprof.png](../images/windows/choose_weaponprof.png)

    \
    \

15. Select the **Description** character creation tab.\

    ![description.png](../images/tabs/description.png)

    \
    \
     Here you can type in lots of role-playing info on your character.\
    \
     Use the **Check All** button to tick all the options and then press
    the **Random** button to have PCGen generate random attributes. Take
    the ticks off the results you like and keep clicking on **Random**
    until all fields are filled to your satisfaction.\
    \
     **Advanced:** You can use HTML tags to modify the appearance of the
    text on a character sheet intended to be exported as an HTML file.
    Using HTML tags on a character sheet will not function correctly
    when exporting to a PDF file.\
    \
     **Note:** Please do not use the colon (" **:** ") character in any
    fields on this page since it can cause problems with opening
    your character. (this will be addressed in a future release)\
    \
     The Notes frame has pre-defined sections for your character's
    biography, description, companions, other assets, and magical items.
    PCGen can't apply bonuses to your character or figure wealth using
    the items here, but they will be noted on your character sheet.\
    \
     The DM Notes node is special as notes put in here will not be
    printed out on character sheets, keeping those particular notes safe
    from prying eyes!\
    \
     You can also make any sort of notes you like in this frame. You can
    use this as a record of your adventures, notes on particular NPCs or
    locations, or anything else you wish.\
    \
     Right-click a folder and select **Add** to add an item beneath
    that folder. Right-click an item and click **Add** to add a new
    folder above that item. With an item selected, you make any notes
    you like in the giant text field to the right.\
    \
     To add a Picture to your character simply click on the browse
    button in the bottom right hand corner and select a jpg file, this
    will add that image to the list of images you can select from. Click
    on the refresh button next to the name of the image to have it
    display in that pane.\
    \

16. Save your character!\
    \
     Use File&gt;Save, File&gt;Save As..., Use the Save icon in the
    button bar, or right click on the character tab and then choose Save
    or Save As.\
