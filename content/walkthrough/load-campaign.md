The first thing the user will need to do once PCGen has been launched is
to load a set of source material data sets. PCGen provides an extensive
library of data sets from a broad range of RPG publishers. Loading these
sets can be accoplished in one of two methods:

[Basic Mode](/menu/sources/selection.html#basic) provides a selection of
the more commonly used data sets as preconfigured collections ready for
loading. This mode also allows the user to add their own preconfigured
set through the creation of a custom PCC file.

[Advanced Mode](/menu/sources/selection.html#advanced) allows the
experienced user access to the complete list of available data sets and
provides complete control over which sets are loaded.
