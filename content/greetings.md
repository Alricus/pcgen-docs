PCGen is a **FREE** Open Source RPG character generator and maintenance
program (d20 Systems mainly) that works on most personal computers (it's
Java-based so: Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Unix are supported). All
datafiles are ASCII so they can be modified by users. All of this work
is performed under the watchful gaze of the PCGen [Board Of
Directors](http://wiki.pcgen.org/index.php?title=Board_of_Directors) .

Mission Statement
=================

To be the world's most flexible d20 character generation and maintenance
software.

About PCGen
===========

The name implies that PCGen is just for generating PCs - which it does -
but the fact that it lets you do that with just about any book published
so far makes it useful for creating NPCs as well! We also have plugins
built for PCGen such as the GMGen series, which help GMs run the game
from their PC/Laptop.

Our goal is to support all RPG material produced and to make it easy for
users to enter their own material. We also recognize that just about
everyone has house rules and we've added support for many of these
variations. For example, some GMs let their players purchase ranks in
exclusive skills, but at a higher cost than cross-class skills. PCGen
lets you set the cost for exclusive skills to accommodate this. We
support a good number of options like this.

The goal to support every RPG book is very ambitious, and considering
the amount of material out there you'd think we need an army to make it
happen! The good news is that we do have an army of Monkeys - our
general hang out area is our Yahoo Message board located at
[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/)
where we meet to discuss who is tackling what sources, what
functionality needs to be done before a source is completely
supportable, answer questions (newbie questions are welcomed!), discuss
potential bugs and refine new functionality requests. We strive hard to
make PCGen useful to gamers and have it do as much of the dirty work
involved in creating a character as possible, while at the same time
balancing that with the publisher's need for sales. Put simply, we want
PCGen to be useful to gamers and at the same time not put anyone out of
business. Obviously if we were to endanger any publisher's source of
revenue they wouldn't be very happy with us. Fortunately we've found a
good balance and the publishers are very satisfied.

How do we manage this? Basically we include in PCGen's data files only
enough information to create a character but we curtail the descriptions
to be just summaries. This means that you can see that there's a class
called Kickyourbutt, and if you advance to 4th level in it you'll see
that your base attack bonus is +12 and you can use a special ability
called "Kick Anyone's Butt (x4)". What you won't see is a description of
the class and any rituals involved in becoming a member of this class,
or how that special ability works - if you want to know the details
you'll need the book. Effectively this means that PCGen is meant for all
the "crunchy bits" in a book, and all the flavor text remains in the
book. If you have the book, Kick Anyone's Butt (x4) is enough for you to
know what you can do - and if you don't have that book, seeing that as
an option might make you want to go take a closer look at that book and
buy it. There lies the magic of PCGen - it's not only extremely useful
for generating characters using books you own, but you can create
characters with books you don't own. This is akin to flipping through
the book at the bookstore, except you brought your dice and a character
sheet with you! This way the publishers get free marketing through PCGen
- they can reach gamers who might not otherwise have heard of them or
their book. So both gamers and game publishers win.

PCGen is open source and therefore free. We have a lot of developers who
donate their time to work on this labor of love - these are the Code
Monkeys listed in the About window within PCGen. Since PCGen is written
in Java it works on any computer which can run Java - which is almost
all of them! We also have a lot of List Monkeys who generously donate
their time to work on the data files. We're always looking for new
recruits, if you'd like to help complete the conversion of a certain
book, or you'd like to see a book added that we haven't included yet,
let us know at the aforementioned yahoo message board. Creating the
data-files is fairly easy and we're always glad to help train new
monkeys! We're endeavoring to make it so you can add and modify the data
from within PCGen itself, but at the moment editing the data files is
done with your favorite text editor (WordPad, Textpad, Edit and even
VI!).

From the Benevolent Dictator
----------------------------

PCGen began in October of 2000 as my own personal project - both to
teach myself Java and as an aid to help convert my high-level campaign
from 1ed to 3e. Just for fun I put it on the net and was amazed when
others wanted to get involved. Things quickly picked up and the pace has
never slackened. It's been a lot of fun and very rewarding to see how
its progressed. The product you have before you is the result of 7 years
of continuous effort on the part of many people. As the Benevolent
Dictator of PCGen I am extremely thrilled at how much time others have
put into it!\

From the Chair Monkey
---------------------

PCGen has been a labour of love and a serious addiction for many of us
Monkeys, it still continues to be a fun and challenging place to be!
Over the last two years the project has continued to thrive and we are
now firmly in the semi professional Open Source space. I am exceedingly
proud of what this team has managed to build so far and am extremely
grateful for the massive community input. We have a roadmap for at least
another 2-3 years, so the future is looking bright!\
