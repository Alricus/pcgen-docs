**Notes on Tag Usage:**

1.  The ADD tag <span class="underline"> MUST </span> be used with at
    least one valid choice (like the CHOOSE tag) or it will not
    function, i.e. If `ADD:FEAT|TYPE=Foo` and the character does not
    qualify for any TYPE=Foo feat, there will be no pop-up or choice.
2.  This tag is a "fire and forget" tag. Once the containing
    object (e.g. Class, Feat, Race, etc.) is applied, and assuming that
    the character qualifies for the object being added, this tag
    will fire. If the object is then removed, the effect of this tag
    will not be removed.
