This file covers the glodal CHOOSE tag in its many different forms. For
the eqmod versions of the CHOOSE tag see [CHOOSE:ABILITY (Equipment
Modifiers)](/list/data/equipmentmodifiers/ability.html)

While the CHOOSE tag is extremely flexible, it should be noted that
support for CHOOSE in class files is still in the works and will cause
problems. This is a known issue, and all I can say is that, "We are
working on it."

When using CHOOSE within an ability you must:

-   Use [ADD:ABILITY](/list/global/add/ability.html) or
    [ADD:FEAT](/list/global/add/feat.html) to activate the
    selection window. Using ABILITY or VFEAT will bypass the CHOOSE tag.
-   Use it in conjunction with a [MULT:YES](/list/data/feats/mult.html)
    tag for it to work properly. *EXCEPTION: `MULT:YES` is not to be
    used with `CHOOSE:NUMBER` .*
