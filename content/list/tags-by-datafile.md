The Meat & Potatoes of it all! The Holy Grail has been found! Houston,
we have landed on the Moon!

Well, okay, so maybe not that exciting, but it is as good as sliced
bread.Â  A file by file listing of all the tags currently in use by
PCGen's list files! How, what, why, where, when... all these questions
answered!

Converting from Code-ese to English is a tough task, so hopefully these
pages are a coherent enough form of English for everyone! (and if you
speak Code-ese, go away! You're a Code Monkey, this area is for List
Monkeys! :p)
