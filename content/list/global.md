Global tabs are tags that can be used in multiple list file types. The
following sections break down Global tags into a logical order for usage
in the list files. More Global tags will be implemented with future
versions of PCGen, making it much easier to create list files.

There are five sub-sections of global tags and four sub-sections for
special application tags.

The five major types of global tags are as folows:

> [Global ADD Tags](/list/global/add.html)
> :   ADD Tags are a series of tags for (as you might guess) adding
>     things to the character. In some cases a pop up window with
>     choices will appear while in others the tag simply grants the item
>     (or items) to the character.
>
> [Global BONUS Tags](/list/global/bonus.html)
> :   BONUS Tags offer only a numerical value to grant the character,
>     either positive or negative. Bonus Tags cannot use text values,
>     only text variables.
>
> [Global CHOOSE Tags](/list/global/choose.html)
> :   CHOOSE Tags are a series of tags for providing methods of
>     user input. The CHOOSE tag is under-documented at this time but we
>     hope to improve on that as time goes by.
>
> [Global PRExxx Tags](/list/global/pre.html)
> :   PRExxx Tags are a series of tags for determining is the
>     PRE-requisites are met to gain the desired item (Feat, Equipment,
>     Class, etc).
>
> [Other Global Tags](/list/global/other.html)
> :   Other Global Tags is a catch all page covering all other
>     global tags. Everything from AUTO:WEAPONPROF to VISION is
>     detailed here.
>
The four types of special application tags are as folows:

> [Global Define Tag and Variables](/list/global/define.html)
> :   The DEFINE statement is explained in complete detail with the
>     current preset variables that can be used. It explains how to put
>     them into the correct order and how to create your own custom
>     DEFINE statements.
>
> [Global KEY Tag](/list/global/key.html)
> :   The KEY statement is explained in complete detail with the current
>     preset variables that can be used. It explains how to put them
>     into the correct order and how to create your own custom
>     DEFINE statements.
>
> [Global Math Operators, Formulas, Symbols and JEP Functions](/list/global/formulas.html)
> :   The Math Operators, Formulas, Symbols, and JEP Functions statement
>     is explained in complete detail with the current preset variables
>     that can be used. It explains how to put them into the correct
>     order and how to create your own custom DEFINE statements.
>
> [Global TYPE Tags](/list/global/type.html)
> :   The TYPE statement is explained in complete detail with the
>     current preset variables that can be used. It explains how to put
