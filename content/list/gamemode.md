Game System files are specific to the rules for a gaming system, such as
3e, Unisystem, D6, etc. These files define what rules apply for that
system, such as Hit Points, vs Vitality Points, Armor Class vs Damage
Reduction, etc.

Each Game Mode consists of the following files:

**bio/biosettings.lst** \*

**bio/locations.lst** \*

**bio/traits.lst** \*

**equipicons.lst** \*

**equipmentslots.lst**

**level.lst**

**load.lst**

**migration.lst**

**miscinfo.lst**

**pointbuymethods\_system.lst** \*

**rules.lst**

**sizeAdjustment.lst** \*

**statsandchecks.lst**

**tips.txt** \*

**\* NOTE:** These files are optional files for the individual
gamemodes. Default versions of these files can be found in a directory
named "default" in the gameModes directory. If a gameMode is loaded
which does not contain one or more of these files then the files from
the default directory are loaded in their place.
