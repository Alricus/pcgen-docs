Unless otherwise stated in the individual LST file class, the following
are a few standard conventions used to make reading these classes
easier.

General Conventions
-------------------

 Source Text 
:   Text taken from source will be indicated in **bold** .

 *&lt;your text goes here&gt;* 
:   The 'Less Than' (&lt;) and 'Greater Than' (&gt;) signs indicate
    where your text will be entered when building a LST object. Unless
    explicitly stated in the lesson text, you will not include the angle
    brackets in your tags.

 *&lt;TAB&gt; Delimiting* 
:   Tags in LST files are &lt;TAB&gt; delimited, that is, the tags are
    separated by TABs. Because this is difficult to show, the LST
    examples will have their tags separated by simple line breaks with
    no additional indentation.

 *TAG* 
:   When referring to a LST tag outside of a LST code example, the tag
    is displayed in all capital letters.

 *Extended LST Lines* 
:   To improve readability, long LST tags will be formated with
    line-breaks with the subsequent lines indented.

Display Fonts
-------------

 *LST Code* 
:   Text meant to display LST code, including LST objects and tags, will
    be displayed in `code font` .

 *LST Objects* 
:   LST objects will be displayed the <span class="lstobj"> LST Object
    Font </span> unless it is being used as part of a LST code example.
    (See LST Code above)

 *LstVariables* 
:   LST variables will be displayed the <span class="lstvar"> LST
    Variable Font </span> .
