The armor proficiency list file is used to set the armor category a
piece of armor belongs to (e.g. Padded, Leather, Studded Leather, Chain
Shirt, etc.) so that PCGen can determine whether or not a character
qualifies to use that armor or not. The 1st field is the name field,
there is no tag for it, just the name of the armor proficiency.

**Example:**

`Studded Leather`

Defines `Studded Leather` as a category of armor to be used in the
associated dataset.
