The weapon proficiency list file is to set what each weapon category a
weapon belongs to (Simple, Martial, Exotic, Natural) so that PCGen can
determine whether or not a character qualifies to use that weapon or
not. The 1st field is the name field, there is no tag for it, just the
name of the weapon proficiency.
