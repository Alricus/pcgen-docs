The shield proficiency list file is used to set the shield category a
shield belongs to (e.g. Buckler, Shield (Light), Shield (Heavy), Tower
Shield) so that PCGen can determine whether or not a character qualifies
to use that shield or not. The 1st field is the name field, there is no
tag for it, just the name of the shield proficiency.

**Example:**

`Shield (Light)`

Defines `Shield (Light)` as a category of shield to be used in the
associated dataset.
