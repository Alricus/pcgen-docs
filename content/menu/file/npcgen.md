PCGen 5.12.x added a non-player character (NPC) generator to PCGen's
evergrowing list of capabilities. The generator will create an NPC from
scratch, or you may select specific options for several parameters from
which the generator will build your NPC.

**NOTE:** The NPC generator utilizes gameMode based XML files to
establish the various options available. As of PCGen version 5.14, the
RSRD (35e) gameMode is the only gameMode supported. Additional gameModes
will be added as time allows.
