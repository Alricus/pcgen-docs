The **Party** command provides a number of options that make managing
groups of PCs easier.

![Party Options](../../images/menus/file/menu_file_2_party.png)

The **Party** command opens up a new set of options for the user to use.

![Opening a Party](../../images/menus/file/menu_file_2_partyopen.png)

The **Open Party** option opens a party file from the last folder PCgen
used to save a file in. The **Open** window will pop up and the user can
select the desired **Party** file and click **Open** . Party files use
the <span class=":lstfile""> .pcp </span> file extension..

The **Close Party** option closes the party files, saving and unloading
all PCs currently loaded.

![Saving a Party](../../images/menus/file/menu_file_2_partysave.png)

The **Save Party** option allows the user to save all the PCs currently
loaded as a "party". The **Save** window will pop up and prompt the user
for the party name. Enter the party name and click the **Save** button
and PCGen will save the party. This in turn allows the user to quickly
load all PCs in the party. This is useful for a DM who manages the PCs
in his campaign, allowing him to load all PCs in the party with one file
name.

The **Save Party As** option allows the user to save the party under a
new filename. This functions much as the **Save** command does for PCs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below the **Save Party** commands you will find a list of the most
recently closed or saved parties. These are included here to allow
convenient loading directly from this menu.
