This option will export your characters to a "Standard" html or xml
file.

The **Standard** selection opens up a pop up window which prompts the
user to select how to export open characters.\
 On the left you can choose either one open character to export, or
check the "Entire party" checkbox to export all open characters.\
 Then you select which Output Sheet template is to be used to export the
character on the right.\
 Once both have been selected, click the 'Export' button and PCGen will
export the character to a file in a folder chosen by the user (PCGen's
Character directory by default) using the name of the character as a
filename.\
 When finished press the 'Close' button.

For more information on the Standard Output Sheets, please see the
[Standard Sheets](/outputsheet/std.html) section
