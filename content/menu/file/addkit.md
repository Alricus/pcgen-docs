The **Add Kit** command opens up a new window containing a set of kits
for the user to apply to his/her character. This is done mainly to help
speed up character creation. Kits can be applied anytime to characters.

In the left hand pane is a list of kits which could be applied to the
character. Kits in red indicate the character does not pass the
prerequisites set in the kit.

In the 5.9.x line Default Monster Kits were added, if you create a new
character and choose the Add Kit menu item before you select a race the
kit list will display all possible Default Monster Kits. If you have
already selected a race Only those Default Monster Kits for which that
race qualifies for will be displayed.

You can click on a kit in the left hand pane to bring up information on
that kit.

You can double click on an item (or select and click the &gt; button) in
the left hand pane to apply it to your character. A Warnings dialog box
will pop up telling you which parts of the kit are not able to be
applied (usually because you do not have enough free slots of feats, or
skill points etc) and then gives you the option to apply or abort the
kit

When you have applied the kit it will appear in the right hand pane.
