**NPC Generator Window**

The **New NPC** command, found under the **File** menu, opens up a new
window containing options for creating random characters within a set of
parameters you can specify. The options for each parameter depend upon
the gameMode you are using. The only gameMode currently supported is the
RSRD (35e) gameMode. Other gameModes will be added as time permits. The
available parameters are:

**NOTE:** You will note several "Edit" buttons. This functionality has
not been added to NPCGen as yet.

**Alignment** - You can specify a specific alignment or a random
selection from a sub-set (such as "any Good") or a random selection from
all available alignments.

**Race** - You can specify a specific race or choose "Any", "Any Core"
or "Any Humanoid" to be randomly selected.

**Gender** - You can set the gender or have it randomly assigned.

**Class/Level** - You can specify up to three classes and levels for
your NPC.

**Character Stats** - You can specify the roll-method used to generate
the base stats for your NPC.

**Name Set** - You can specify which of the name-sets to use to generate
a name for your NPC.
