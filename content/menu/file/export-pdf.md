![Export PDF Window](../../images/windows/export_pdf.png)

This option will export your characters to a Portable Document Format
file with the .PDF file extension. Please make sure you have a valid
application to view it, such as Adobe's Acrobat Reader.

The **to PDF** selection opens up a pop up window which prompts the user
to select how to export open characters.\
 On the left you can choose either one open character to export, or
check the "Entire party" checkbox to export all open characters.\
 Then you select which Output Sheet template is to be used to export the
character on the right.\
 Once both have been selected, click the 'Export' button and PCGen will
export the character to a file in a folder chosen by the user (PCGen's
Character directory by default) using the name of the character as a
filename.\
 When finished press the 'Close' button.

**NOTE:** HTML tags used in the 'Character Notes' will not function
properly when exporting the character sheet to PDF.

For more information on the PDF Output Sheets, please see the [PDF
Sheets](/outputsheet/pdf.html) section
