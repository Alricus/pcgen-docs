The **Base Tab** has everything required to make a simple Feat.  The
remaining tabs are for more advanced Feat creation.  The Feats created
will be saved into the data/custom directory under the name of
customFeats.lst.

The **Feat Name** is where you will enter the name for your Feat.

The **Desc Product Identity** is used to show that the Description field
is closed content. Permission must be gained from the publisher to
release it into official files.

The **Description** is the short description of the feat from the source
material. If that one line is not OGC, then the **Desc Product
Identity** should be selected.

The two **Type** windows, **Available** and **Selected** are used to
create a list of languages which the Feat grants.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted
    language between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on a
    Type name.
-   New Types can be added by manually typing them and then clicking the
    **Add** button

The **Cost** is how many feat points the feat costs. A decimal value
such as 0.5 would mean that it only costs 1/2 a feat point.

The **Visible** is where you will indicate whether and how you want the
feat name to appear and print. The options are outlined below:

-   **Yes** - Shows the feat name in PCGen and on export to a character
    sheet
-   **No** - Hides the feat name in PCGen and on export to a
    character sheet.
-   **Display** - Displays the feat name in PCGen but not on the
    character sheet.
-   **Export** - Hides the feat name from PCGen but displays it on the
    character sheet.

The **Multiples Allowed** is used to determine if a feat can be taken
multiple times.

The **Stacks** is used to determine if the feat benefits may be stacked
on one another.

The **Spell Level** is where you will enter the additional levels added
to spells that use the Feat. Eg Empower Spell uses a spell slot two
levels higher so 2 is entered in this field.

The **Source** field is a text window for listing what source material
the Feat is from.  If it is a custom created Feat, then you can leave
this blank or simply put in "custom"

The **Product Identity** checkbox is to denote if the Feat's name being
created is the Product Identity of a publisher

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Feat creation or save it to the customFeats.lst
file.
