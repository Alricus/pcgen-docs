The **Races Tab** is used to define the specific race which worships the
deity, if appropriate.

The two **Racial Worshippers** windows, **Available** and **Selected**
are used to create a list of races which follow the deity.

-   The race names in the **Available** window are drawn from whichever
    sources were loaded into PCGen. (i.e. If you have SRD and Soveriegn
    Stone loaded as sources, then races from both sources will appear in
    the window.)
-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted race
    name between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on a race name.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the deity creation or save it to the customdeities.lst
file.
