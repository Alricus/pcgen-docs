![Deity Editor: Languages
Tab](../../../images/editors/deity/languagestab.png)

The **Languages** tab is used to define which languages are granted to
the follower of the deity.

The two **Granted Languages** windows, **Available** and **Selected**
are used to create a list of languages granted to the deity's followers.

-   The language names in the **Available** window are drawn from
    whichever sources were loaded into PCGen. (i.e. If you have SRD and
    Soveriegn Stone loaded as sources, then languages from both sources
    will appear in the window.)
-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted
    language between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on a
    language name in either window.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the deity creation or save it to the customdeities.lst
file.
