![Deity Editor: Domains
Tab](../../../images/editors/deity/domainstab.png)

The **Domains Tab** is used to generate the list of domains for the
deity which a cleric would choose from.

The two **Granted Domains** windows, **Available** and **Selected** are
used to create a list of domains which the deity grants.

-   The domain names in the **Available** window are drawn from
    whichever sources were loaded into PCGen. (i.e. If you have SRD and
    Soveriegn Stone loaded as sources, then Domains from both sources
    will appear in the window.)
-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted domain
    between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on a domain name.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the deity creation or save it to the customdeities.lst
file.
