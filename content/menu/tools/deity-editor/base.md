The **Base Tab** has everything required to make a simple Class.Â  The
remaining tabs are for more advanced Class creation. The Classes created
will be saved into the data/custom directory under the name of
customClasses.lst.

The **Deity Name** is where you will enter the name for your deity.

The **Holy Item** is where you will enter the name/description of the
holy item for the deity.

The **Deities Alignment** drop down menu is for selecting the deity
alignment.

The **Description** window is where you will type in a description of
the deity (i.e. "God of the Dawn")

The **Deity's Favored Weapons** windows, **Available** and **Selected**
are used to create a list of all the favored weapons, primarily for use
with the War domain.

The weapon names in the **Available** window are drawn from whichever
sources were loaded into PCGen. (i.e. If you have SRD and Soveriegn
Stone loaded as sources, then weapon names from both sources will appear
in the window.)

The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted weapon
between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on a weapon name.

The **Source** window, is a text window for listing what source material
the deity is from. If it is a custom created deity, then you can leave
this blank or simply put in "custom"

The **Product Identity** checkbox is to denote if the deity's name being
created is the Product Identity of a publisher

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the deity creation or save it to the customdeities.lst
file.
