The **Skills Tab** is used to define the skills granted to followers of
the deity.

The three **Granted Skills** windows, **Available, Selected Class
Skills** and **Selected Cross Class Skills** are used to create a list
of class and cross class skills granted to the deity's followers.

-   The skill names in the **Available** window are drawn from whichever
    sources were loaded into PCGen. (i.e. If you have SRD and Soveriegn
    Stone loaded as sources, then skills from both sources will appear
    in the window.)
-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted skill
    name between the **Available** window and whichever **Selected**
    window they are situated next to. Double clicking has no effect in
    the skills tab.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the deity creation or save it to the customdeities.lst
file.
