![Deity Editor: Weapons
Tab](../../../images/editors/deity/weaponstab.png)

The **Weapons Tab** is used choose which weapon proficiencies are
granted to followers of the deity.

The two **Granted Weapon Proficiencies** windows, **Available** and
**Selected** are used to create a list of weapon proficiencies granted
to the deity's followers.

-   The names in the **Available** window are drawn from whichever
    sources were loaded into PCGen. (i.e. If you have SRD and Soveriegn
    Stone loaded as sources, then weapon proficiencies from both sources
    will appear in the window.)
-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted weapon
    proficiency name between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on a
    weapon proficiency name.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the deity creation or save it to the customdeities.lst
file.
