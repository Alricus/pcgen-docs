![Deity Editor: Followers
Tab](../../../images/editors/deity/followerstab.png)

The **Followers Tab** is used to define the requirements needed by the
deity's followers.

The two **Allowed Worshiper Alignment** windows, **Available** and
**Selected** are used to create a list of alignments required to follow
the deity.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted
    alignment between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on
    an alignment.
-   The **Qualifiers** has a choice of either none or VARDEFINED.
    VARDEFINED allows you to access the **Variable** drop down list.
-   The **Variable** list is to choose a special ability/feature which a
    follower is required to have.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the deity creation or save it to the customdeities.lst
file.
