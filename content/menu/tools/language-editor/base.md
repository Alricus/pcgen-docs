![Language Editor: Base
Tab](../../../images/editors/language/basetab.png)

The **Base Tab** has everything required to make a new Language.  The
remaining tabs are for more advanced Language creation.  The Languages
created will be saved into the data/custom directory under the name of
customLanguages.lst.

The **Language** is where you will enter the name for your Language.

The two **Type** windows, **Available** and **Selected** are used to
create a list of types of languages.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted
    language between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on a
    Type name.
-   New Types can be added by manually typing them and then clicking the
    **Add** button

The **Product Identity** checkbox is to denote if the Languages's name
being created is the Product Identity of a publisher

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Language creation or save it to the
customLanguages.lst file.
