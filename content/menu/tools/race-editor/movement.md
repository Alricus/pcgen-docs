![Race Editor: Movement
Tab](../../../images/editors/race/movementtab.png)

The **Movement Tab** is used to add the Type and Speed of the different
movement types the race has.

The two windows, **Tag** and **Selected** are used to create a list of
Movement Types.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the selected Movement
    Type between the 2 windows.
-   Note: Both a Movement Type must be selected and a Movement Rate
    keyed in before the **Add** button is clicked.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Race creation or save it to the customRaces.lst
file.
