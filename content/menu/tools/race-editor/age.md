The **Age Tab** is to add the age ranges to the Race.

Statistics can be added for each **Name** (Age Category - Adulthood,
Middle Age, Old & Venerable).

-   **Min Age** - Minimum Age to fall into the Age Category
-   **Roll** - What dice to roll & add to **Min Age** to get a random
    age for the Age Category.
-   **Max Age** - The Maximum Age to fall into the Age Category

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Race creation or save it to the customRace.lst
file.
