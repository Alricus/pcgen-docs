The **Weapons Tab** is used to add a Granted Weapon Proficiencies for
the Race being created.

The three **Granted Weapon Proficiencies** windows, **Available,** **All
Granted** and **A choice from these will be granted** are used to create
a list of Granted Weapon Proficiencies.

-   The two sets of **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the
    highlighted Granted Weapon Proficiencies between the 3 windows.
    Double clicking does not work in this window.
-   The weapons in the **All Granted** window are the ones that all
    members of this race know automatically.
-   **A choice from these will be granted** are additional weapons of
    which only one may be selected.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Race creation or save it to the customRaces.lst
file.
