The **Classes Tab** is used to add Favored Classes for the Race being
created.

The two **Favored Classes** windows, **Available** and **Selected** are
used to create a list of Favored Classes.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted Favored
    Class between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on a
    Favored Class.
-   Note: If "Any" is selected, the character's highest level class is
    considered Favored

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Race creation or save it to the customRaces.lst
file.
