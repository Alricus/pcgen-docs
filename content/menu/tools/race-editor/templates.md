![Race Editor: Templates
Tab](../../../images/editors/race/templatestab.png)

The **Templates Tab** is used to add Granted Templates for the Race
being created.

The three **Granted Templates** windows, **Available,** **All Granted**
and **A choice from these will be granted** are used to create a list of
Granted Templates.

-   The two sets of **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the
    highlighted Granted Templates between the 3 windows. Double clicking
    does not work in this window.
-   The templates in the **All Granted** window are the ones that all
    members of this race automatically have.
-   **A choice from these will be granted** are templates of which only
    one may be selected.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Race creation or save it to the customRaces.lst
file.
