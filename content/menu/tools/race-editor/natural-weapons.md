![Race Editor: Natural Weapons
Tab](../../../images/editors/race/naturalweaponstab.png)

The **Natural Weapons Tab** is used to add the Type and Details of the
different Natural Weapons the race has.

The two windows, **Tag** and **Selected** are used to create a list of
Natural Weapons.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the selected Natural
    Weapon between the 2 windows.
-   Note: A name, relevant damage types, number of attacks, hands
    required and damage details must be selected before the **Add**
    button is clicked.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Race creation or save it to the customRaces.lst
file.
