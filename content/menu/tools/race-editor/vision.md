The **Vision Tab** is used to add the Type and Distance of the different
vision types the race has.

The two windows, **Tag** and **Selected** are used to create a list of
Vision Types.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the selected Vision
    Type between the 2 windows.
-   Note: Both a Vision Type must be selected and a Vision Distance
    keyed in before the **Add** button is clicked.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Race creation or save it to the customRaces.lst
file.
