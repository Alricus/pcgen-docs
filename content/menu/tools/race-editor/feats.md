![Race Editor: Feats Tab](../../../images/editors/race/featstab.png)

The **Feats Tab** is used to add Granted Feats for the Race being
created.

The three **Granted Feats** windows, **Available,** **Selected Feats**
and **Selected Monster Feats** are used to create a list of Granted
Feats.

-   The two sets of **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the
    highlighted Granted Feats between the 3 windows. Double clicking
    does not work in this window.
-   The feats in the **Selected Feats** window are bonus feats that all
    members of this race automatically have.
-   **Selected Monster Feats** window are bonus feats that all members
    of this monster race automatically have (Note: This is used Only
    with Default Monsters ON).

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Race creation or save it to the customRaces.lst
file.
