Tab](../../../images/editors/race/virtualfeatstab.png)

The **Virtual Feats Tab** is used to add a Virtual Feats for natural
weapons that the Race being created will have.

The two **Granted Virtual Feats** windows, **Available** and
**Selected** are used to create a list of Granted Virtual Feats.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted Granted
    Virtual Feats between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on a
    Granted Virtual Feats.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Race creation or save it to the customRaces.lst
file.
