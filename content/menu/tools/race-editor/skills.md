The **Skills Tab** is used to add a Granted Skill for the Race being
created.

The three **Granted Skill** windows, **Available,** **All Granted** and
**A choice from these will be granted** are used to create a list of
Granted Skills.

-   The two sets of **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the
    highlighted Skill between the 3 windows. Double clicking does not
    work in this window.
-   The skills in the **All Granted** window are the ones that all
    members of this race know automatically.
-   **A choice from these will be granted** are additional skills of
    which only one may be selected.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Race creation or save it to the customRaces.lst
file.
