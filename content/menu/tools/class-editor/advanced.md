Tab](../../../images/editors/class/advancedtab.png)

The **Advanced Tab** is to add any uncommon/miscellaneous features to
the Class which were not covered by the other tabs.

The three **Miscellaneous Tags** windows, **Tag, Tag Value,** and
**Selected** are used to create a list of tags to be added to the Class
lst file.

-   The **Tag** drop down list is a list of all global tags. Choose
    whichever one is appropriate for the tag you wish to add to the
    lst file.
-   The **Tag Value** window is where you enter the information to be
    added after the colon, attached to the chosen **Tag** . The **Tag
    Value** must be entered EXACTLY as it is meant to be seen after the
    **Tag** . ( i.e. to add an AC bonus of +1, choose BONUS from the
    **Tag** list, then enter COMBAT|AC|1 into the **Tag Value** window.)
-   The **Selected** window is where any tags you create and add will
    be listed.
-   The **Add** button combines the **Tag** and **Tag Value** fields and
    adds them into the **Selected** window.
-   The **Remove** button will remove the tag from the **Selected**
    window

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Class creation or save it to the customClass.lst
file.
