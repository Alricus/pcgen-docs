![Class Editor: Weapon
Tab](../../../images/editors/class/weaponstab.png)

The **Weapons Tab** is used to add a Granted Weapon Proficiencies for
the Class being created.

The three **Granted Weapon Proficiencies** windows, **Available, All
Granted** and **A choice from these will be granted** are used to create
a list of Granted Weapon Proficiencies.

-   The two sets of **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the
    highlighted Granted Weapon Proficiencies between the 3 windows.
    Double clicking does not work in this window.
-   The weapons in the **All Granted** window are the ones that all
    members of this Class know automatically.
-   A choice from these will be granted are additional weapons of which
    only one may be selected.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Class creation or save it to the customClasses.lst
file.
