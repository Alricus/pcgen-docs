PCGen includes a treasure generator that can be used to randomly
generate treasure for any PC, NPC, or monster created by PCGen. The
generator uses the same gameMode based XML data files used by PCGen's
built-in NPC generator. As of PCGen version 5.14, the only gameMode
supported by the treasure generator is the RSRD (35e) gameMode.

You will find PCGen's built-in **Treasure Generator** command under the
**Tools** menu.

The steps to use the generator are as follows:

1.  Create, or load, a PC/NPC/Monster with PCGen.
2.  Select the **Tools** -&gt; **Treasure Generator** command. You will
    be presented with the "Treasure Generator" window.

3.  Select the appropriate **CR** , or "Challenge Rating", for the
    PC/NPC, from the "Table" pull-down menu, and then click the
    **Generate** button.
4.  Add the generated treasure to the PC with the **Add to PC** button.
5.  Close the "Treasure Generator" window.

Congratulations! You have succesfully generated and added treasure to
your PC/NPC.
