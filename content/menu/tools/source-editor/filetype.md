Tab](../../../images/editors/source/filetypetab.png)

The **File Type Tab** allows entry of the .lst files that make up the
Source. The Sources created will be saved into the data/custom directory
under the name of customSources.lst.

To add new list files to the source, click on the **Add** button after
choosing a type from the drop down box. A file browser will then appear
that will allow you to select the .pcc or .lst file to add. Remove list
items by clicking on the **Remove** button.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Source creation or save it to the customSources.lst
file.
