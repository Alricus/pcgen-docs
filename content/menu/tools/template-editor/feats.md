![Template Editor: Feats
Tab](../../../images/editors/template/featstab.png)

The **Feats Tab** is used to add Granted Feats for the Template being
created.

The two **Granted Feats** windows, **Available** and **Selected** are
used to create a list of Granted Feats.

-   The two sets of **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the
    highlighted Granted Feats between the 2 windows, as will double
    clicking on a Granted Feat.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Template creation or save it to the
customTemplates.lst file.
