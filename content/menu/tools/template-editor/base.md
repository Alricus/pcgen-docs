Tab](../../../images/editors/template/basetab.png)

The **Base Tab** has everything required to make a simple Template.  The
remaining tabs are for more advanced Template creation. The Templates
created will be saved into the data/custom directory under the name of
customTemplates.lst.

The **Template Name** is where you will enter the name for your
Template.

The **Visible** option determines whether the template name is hidden in
PCGen & or the character sheet output. The options are:

-   **Yes** - Shows the Template name in PCGen and on export to a
    character sheet (This is the default setting)
-   **No** - Hides the Template name in PCGen and on export to a
    character sheet.
-   **Display** - Displays the Template name in PCGen but not on the
    character sheet.
-   **Export** - Hides the Template name from PCGen but displays it on
    the character sheet.

The **Removable** flag determines whether a character can remove a
template once it has been selected by a character.

The **Gender Locked** option sets the character's Gender and disables
the ability to change it.

The **Wpn Non Prof Penalty** is used to set the character's penalty for
non proficiency in a weapon to the specified numeric value. This can
only be a negative number or zero

The **Bonus Skill Points / Level** is where you will enter additional
skill points that your Template receives with each level increase. This
happens before multiplication of the first class level's skill points.

The **Bonus Starting Feats** is where you will enter additional feats
that your Template receives at 1 ^st^ level. These are unrestricted
feats.

The **CR** is where you will enter the starting Challenge Rating of your
Template. For CR's less than 1, fractions are used (1/2, 1/4, 3/4).

The **Level Adjustment** is where you will enter the Effective Character
Level (ECL) of the Template.

The **Size** is where you will enter the size class of your Template.
Size is used in determining TO-HIT, AC, and affects some skills.

The **Sub Race** option sets the name of the sub race the character is ,
the default is none. If Yes is <span
style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana"> specified </span> then it
will place the name of the template in parenthesis after the race on
character sheet output.

The **Sub Region** option sets the name of the region the character is
from, the default is none. If Yes is <span
style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana"> specified </span> then it
will place the name of the template in parenthesis after the race on
character sheet output.

The two **Type** windows, **Available** and **Selected** are used to
create a list of types which the template is part of.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted type
    between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on a type name.
-   New types can be added by manually typing them and then clicking the
    **Add** button
-   Important for matching up with Monster HD, and for references to
    race, such as the Rangers Favored Enemy.

The **Source** field is a text window for listing what source material
the Template is from.  If it is a custom created Template, then you can
leave this blank or simply put in "custom"

The **Product Identity** checkbox is to denote if the Template's name
being created is the Product Identity of a publisher

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Template creation or save it to the
customTemplates.lst file.
