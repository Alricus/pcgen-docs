![Template Editor: Languages
Tab](../../../images/editors/template/languagestab.png)

The **Languages Tab** is used to add a Granted Languages for the
Template being created.

The three **Granted Languages** windows, **Available,** **All Granted**
and **A choice from these will be granted** are used to create a list of
Bonus Languages.

-   The two sets of **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the
    highlighted Granted Languages between the 3 windows. Double clicking
    does not work in this window.
-   The Languages in the **All Granted** box are the languages that all
    members of this Template know automatically.
-   **A choice from these will be granted** are additional languages
    that are only available when the character is created. The selection
    is limited by intelligence.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Template creation or save it to the
customTemplates.lst file.
