![Template Editor: Movement
Tab](../../../images/editors/template/movementtab.png)

The **Movement Tab** is used to add the Type and Speed of the different
movement types the Template has.

The **Movement Rate Type of** selection determines the additional
movement types granted by the template. The different options available
include:

-   **MOVE** - Sets the Type and Speed of the different movement types
    the race has.
-   **MOVEA** - This will only add to existing movement types (A special
    type of ALL adds to all movement types the character has).
-   **MOVECLONE** - Adjusts based on a default rate

The two windows, **Tag** and **Selected** are used to create a list of
Movement Types.

-   If **Movement Rate Type of** is **MOVE** , then just the **Movement
    Type** and **Add/Set to** and a rate is added.
-   If **Movement Rate Type of** is **MOVEA** or **MOVECLONE** , then
    the **Movement Type** can be any of the available adjustment types.
-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the selected Movement
    Type and options between the 2 windows.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Template creation or save it to the
customTemplates.lst file.
