![Template Editor: Abilities
Tab](../../../images/editors/template/abilitiestab.png)

The **Abilities Tab** is used to add the Level/Hit Dice based abilities
that the template receives.

The two **Ability** windows, **Available Options** and **Selected** are
used to create a list of Level/Hit Dice based abilities that the
Template grants.

-   The **Tag Type** is either **HD** or **LEVEL**
    -   If the **Tag Type** is **HD** , then the **Level Number/Hit
        Dice** is the numeric values indicating the range (1-3) or
        minimum (4+) hit dice the character must have before the ability
        is granted to the character.
    -   If the **Tag Type** is **LEVEL** , then the **Level Number/Hit
        Dice** is the level the character must have before the ability
        is granted to the character.\
-   The **Ability Type** is the type of ability that characters who
    exceed the **HD** or **LEVEL** requirements get. It can be:
    -   **DR** - Damage Reduction
    -   **SR** - Spell Resistance
    -   **CR** - Challenge Rating
    -   **SA** - Special Ability
    -   **FEAT** - Bonus Feat\
-   The **Ability Details** field contains the bonus details for the
    **DR** , **SR** , **CR** , **SA** or **FEAT** gained at the **HD**
    or **LEVEL** selected.\
-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the selected/entered
    options into the **Selected** window.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Template creation or save it to the
customTemplates.lst file.
