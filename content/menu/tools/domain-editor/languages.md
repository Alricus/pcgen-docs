![Domain Editor: Languages
Tab](../../../images/editors/domain/languagestab.png)

The **Languages Tab** is used to add granted languages to a priest who
selects the domain being created.

The two **Granted Languages** windows, **Available** and **Selected**
are used to create a list of languages which the domain grants.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted
    language between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on a
    language name.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the domain creation or save it to the customDomains.lst
file.
