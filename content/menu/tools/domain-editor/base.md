The **Base Tab** has everything required to make a simple domain. The
remaining tabs are for more advanced domain creation.Â  The domains
created will be saved into the data/custom directory under the name of
customDomains.lst.

The **Domain Name** is where you will enter the name for your domain.

The **Description** window is where you will type in a description of
the domain powers (i.e. "Turn or Destroy earth creatures as a good
cleric turns undead")

The **Source** window, is a text window for listing what source material
the domain is from. If it is a custom created domain, then you can leave
this blank or simply put in "custom"

The **Product Identity** checkbox is to denote if the domain's name
being created is the Product Identity of a publisher

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the domain creation or save it to the customDomains.lst
file.
