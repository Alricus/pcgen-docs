![Domain Editor: Weapons
Tab](../../../images/editors/domain/weaponstab.png)

The **Weapons Tab** is used to add the ability to use weapons not
normally available to clerics to a priest who selects the domain being
created.

The two **Granted Weapon Proficiencies** windows, **Available** and
**Selected** are used to create a list of weapon proficiencies which the
domain grants.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted weapon
    proficiency between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on the
    weapon proficiency name.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the domain creation or save it to the customDomains.lst
file.
