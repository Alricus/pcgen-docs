![Domain Editor: Skills
Tab](../../../images/editors/domain/skillstab.png)

The **Skills Tab** is used to add the ability to use weapons not
normally available to clerics to a priest who selects the domain being
created.

The three **Granted Skills** windows, **Available** , **Selected Class
Skills** and **Selected Cross Class Skills** are used to create a list
of skills which the domain grants.

-   The two sets of **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the
    highlighted weapon proficiency between the 3 windows. Double
    clicking does not work in this window.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the domain creation or save it to the customDomains.lst
file.
