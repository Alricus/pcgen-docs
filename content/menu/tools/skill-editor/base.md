The **Base Tab** has everything required to make a new Skill.  The
remaining tabs are for more advanced Skill creation. The Skills created
will be saved into the data/custom directory under the name of
customSkills.lst.

The **Skill Name** is where you will enter the name for your Skill.

The **Key Stat** determines which statistic bonus will be used with this
skill

The **Armor Check** determines whether the armor check penalty is
applied or not and whether weight has an impact on the skill

The **Use Untrained** flag determines if the skill can be used if no
ranks are taken

The **Exclusive** flag determines if only some classes can obtain skill
ranks

The two **Type** windows, **Available** and **Selected** are used to
create a list of types of Skills.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted Skill
    between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on a Type name.
-   New Types can be added by manually typing them and then clicking the
    **Add** button

The **Source** field is a text window for listing what source material
the Skill is from.  If it is a custom created Skill, then you can leave
this blank or simply put in "custom"

The **Product Identity** checkbox is to denote if the Skills's name
being created is the Product Identity of a publisher

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Skill creation or save it to the customSkills.lst
file.
