![Skill Editor: Skills Tab](../../../images/editors/skill/skillstab.png)

The **Skills Tab** is used to add a Skill for the Skill being created.

The three **Granted Skills** windows, **Available,** **Selected Class
Skills** and **Selected Cross Class Skills** are used to create a list
of Granted Skills.

-   The two sets of **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the
    highlighted Granted Skills between the 3 windows. Double clicking
    does not work in this window.
-   The weapons in the **Selected Class Skills** window are the ones
    that all who obtain ranks in this Skill know automatically.
-   **Selected Cross Class Skills** are additional skills of which only
    one may be selected.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Skill creation or save it to the customSkills.lst
file.
