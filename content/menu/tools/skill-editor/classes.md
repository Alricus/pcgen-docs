![Skill Editor: Classes
Tab](../../../images/editors/skill/classestab.png)

The **Classes Tab** is used to add Favored Classes for the Skill being
created.

The three **Favored Classes** windows, **Available, Class Skill** and
**Not Allowed** are used to create a list of Favored Classes.

-   The two sets of **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the
    highlighted Favored Class between the windows. Double clicking does
    not work in this screen.
-   **Class Skill** indicates that the selected class can obtain skill
    ranks at a reduced cost.

**Not Allowed** indicates that the class cannot obtain any ranks in this
skill.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Skill creation or save it to the customSkills.lst
file.
