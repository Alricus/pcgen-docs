![Skill Editor: Synergy
Tab](../../../images/editors/skill/synergytab.png)

The **Synergy** **Tab** is used to define the synergy bonuses that other
skills provide.

The two windows, **Available** and **Selected** are used to create a
list of skills that give a synergy bonus to this Skill.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted
    alignment between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on
    an skill.
-   The **Skill Ranks** is the minimum ranks in the associated skill for
    the synergy bonus to apply..
-   The **Synergy Bonus** is the bonus received from the associated
    skill if the minimum skill ranks are present.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Skill creation or save it to the customdeities.lst
file.
