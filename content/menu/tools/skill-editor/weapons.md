The **Weapons Tab** is used to add a Granted Weapon Proficiencies for
the Skill being created.

The two **Granted Weapon Proficiencies** windows, **Available** and
**Selected** are used to create a list of Granted Weapon Proficiencies.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted Granted
    Weapon Proficiencies between the 2 windows, as will double clicking
    on the left window.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Skill creation or save it to the customSkills.lst
file.
