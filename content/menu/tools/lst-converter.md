The **Lst Converter** is meant to aid anyone who creates their own
custom list files. Its main purpose to keep custom LST files created
in previous versions current by updating them to the current code. Its
functions are limited and will not fix bugs or convert really old files
to the current version. You cannot, for example, convert files from
PCGen 2.x to the current version nor can you use it to adjust for
different gameModes. The best method for using the LST converter on
files from version older then one prior version is to run the LST
Converter in each version on the dataset successively until you reach
the current version.

To run the LST Converter on a dataset choose LST Converter from the
Tools menu and then select the directory in which the dataset resides.
You will be presented with a window listing the files and tags to be
updated. You may choose which files and tags you wish to convert and
then run the converter.
