![Spell Editor: Classes
Tab](../../../images/editors/spell/classestab.png)

The **Classes Tab** is used to set the spell level for the different
classes who can use the Spell being created.

The two **Classes** windows, **Available** and **Selected** are used to
create a list of classes who use the spell and at what level.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the class and selected
    level between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on the
    class name.
-   Note: You must select a level before adding the class or the class
    will be given the spell at level 0.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Spell creation or save it to the customSpells.lst
file.
