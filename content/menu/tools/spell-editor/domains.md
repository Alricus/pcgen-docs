![Spell Editor: Domains
Tab](../../../images/editors/spell/domainstab.png)

The **Domains Tab** is used to set the spell level for the different
domains that include the Spell being created.

The two **Domains** windows, **Available** and **Selected** are used to
create a list of domains that include the spell and at what level.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the domain and selected
    level between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on the
    domain name.
-   Note: You must select a level before adding the class or the domain
    will be given the spell at level one.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Spell creation or save it to the customSpells.lst
file.
