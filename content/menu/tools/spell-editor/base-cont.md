![Spell Editor: ?Base2? Tab](../../../images/editors/spell/base2tab.png)

The **?Base2? Tab** is used to add what "types" are associated with the
spell. The user can create new types.

The two **Type** windows, **Available** and **Selected** are used to
create a list of types which the Spell belongs to.

-   The **Add** and **Remove** buttons will move the highlighted type
    between the 2 windows, as will double clicking on a type name.
-   New Types can be added by typing the name and clicking on the
    add button.
-   The **Variants** are for when an item (wand, scroll, etc.) and you
    need to choose an effect at time of item creation (eg.
    Endure Elements).

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons, which appear on every tab, are used
to either cancel the Spell creation or save it to the customSpells.lst
file.
