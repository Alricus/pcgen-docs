![PCGen Equipment Options](../../../images/preferences/equipment.png)

The **Equipment** options allow the user to setup how custom equipment
is handled when it is created.

The **Allow Metamagic feats on potions, wands, etc.** allows the user to
apply metamagic feats to customized equipment. If this option is
deselected the ability to add metamagic feats to equipment will not be
used.

The **Potion Maximum Spell Level** is used to select a spell level from
0-9. This defaults to 3 per the Game Masters Rules potion creation
rules.

The **Wand Maximum Spell Level** is used to select a spell level from
0-9. This defaults to 4 per the Game Masters Rules wand creation rules.

The **Equipment Auto Creation** menu has several options for creating
custom magic items at PCGen's startup. \*\*\*NOTE\*\*\* Some of these
options, when selected will cause PCGen to take a considerable amount of
time to start while it creates the items specified.

-   The **Load from lst files only** option only loads items that were
    loaded from sources and nothing more.
-   The **Racially resized, armor, shields, and clothing** will
    automatically resize items for smaller or larger PC's when created.
-   The **Masterwork** option allows any item to be automatically made
    masterwork when created.
-   The **Magic (+1 to +5)** allows items to be made magical without
    being made from a masterwork item or from special materials.
-   The **Exotic Materials** option allows items made from Adamantine,
    Darkwood, and Mithral to be created when creating custom equipment.
