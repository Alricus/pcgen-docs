The **Game Mode/Campaign** option allows the user to select what rule

As of now PCGen supports these following Game Modes:

-   3.5e - [Revised (v.3.5) System
    Reference Document.](http://www.wizards.com/D20/article.asp?x=srd35)
-   3e - [System Reference
    Document](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/files/3.0%20SRD/)
    (default selection).
-   Modern - [d20 Modern System
    Reference Document.](http://www.wizards.com/D20/article.asp?x=msrd)

Once you select a Game Mode/Campaign the GAMEMODE Tag in the source .pcc
files under the Data folder will determine if the sources show up for a
given Game Mode.
