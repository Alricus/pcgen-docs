![Hit Points Menu Options](../../../images/preferences/hitpoints.png)

The **Hit points** menu option allows the user to customize which method
to use when the PC is created to determine how Hit Points are allocated.

The **User Rolled** option is the default that PCGen uses, this means
that the users must enter their Hit Points Manually using the HP button
found on either the Summary Tab or the Classes tab.

The **Random** option will present a random hitpoint total between 1 and
the hit die type of the class/race when a class level is added. The user
can modify this total if desired.

The **Average** option will always give the average hit points as
defined by the hit die type of the class/race.

The **Always maximum** option will always give the maximum hit points as
defined by the hit die type of the class/race.

The **Percentage** option allows the user to enter a percentage of the
maximum hit points as defined by the hit die type of the class/race.

The **Average, Rounded Up** option will always give the average hit
points as defined by the hit die type of the class/race rounded up if
the average results in a fraction.

The **Max Hp at first level** option gives you maximum Hit Points at
first level when you are creating your character.

The **Do not apply to Racial Hit Dice** option modifies the Max Hp at
first level option so it only applied to character class levels.
