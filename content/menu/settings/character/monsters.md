The **Monsters** option allows certain monster rules to be applied. The
checkmark by each option signifies that it is selected to be used for PC
creation.

The **Use HD +/- instead of monster classes** means that you add Hit
Dice to monsters as opposed to Monster classes.

The **Ignore Monster HD Cap** will allow the user to exceed the maximum
HD as defined in the data monster files.
