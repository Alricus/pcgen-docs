Options](../../../images/preferences/abilities.png)

The **Ability scores** menu allows the user to choose what method that
PCGen will use to determine how to build the PC.

The **User Rolled** option allows you to roll up the stats using dice,
and then manually enter the results into PCGen.

The **All the Same** option will set all of the stats to the value you
select in the dropdown.

The **Purchase Mode** menu allows the user to call up the [Purchase Mode
Window](/menu/settings/character/purchase-method.html) and define their
own Purchase Mode Methods.

\*\*\* New 5.9.3

If Random dice rolling methods have been added to the miscinfo.lst file
in the gameMode then an additional menu will appear allowing you to
select one of those methods to generate random stats. When chosen a
button labeled Roll will appear on the summary Tab and clicking it will
regenerate your ability scores using the selected rolling method. To add
your own dice rolling methods see the
[ROLLMETHOD](/list/system/gamemode-miscinfo/rollmethod.html) tag entry
for miscinfo.lst files for details.
