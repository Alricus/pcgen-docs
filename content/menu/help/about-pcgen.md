PCGen community is also provided. Clicking on either of the WWW site or
the Email List links will take you to the appropriate web sites that are
listed within the button.

The **Code, List, Test** and **Engineering** sub-tabs will display a
list of the contributors by their general Monkey Groupings.

The **Libraries** tab displays a list of the libraries used by the PCGen
code-base.

The **Licensing** tab displays the terms if the licenses used by the
PCGen team in the production of PCGen and its data sets.

The **Awards** tab displays a list of the awards PCGen has won over the
years.

The **Sponsors** tab displays list of PCGen's current sponsors.
