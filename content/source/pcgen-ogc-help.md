**Game Mode: 3e and 35e**

The PCGen Open Gaming Content dataset contains generally useful items
which are detailed below. These items existence may be implied or
extrapolated from other sources but are not specifically detailed. They
are provided here under the terms of the Open Gaming License. For the
moment this list is small but may grow as users suggest additional
useful items, post your suggestions to our [PCGen Yahoo
group](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/) .

### Equipment

>   ---------------------- -----------
>   **Equipment Name**     **Cost**
>   Quiver                 1 sp
>   Sheath                 1 sp
>   Armor Padding          5 gp
>   Cap (Steel)            1 gp
>   Helmet (Visored )      5 gp
>   Bracers of Armor +9    81000 gp
>   Bracers of Armor +10   100000 gp
>   ---------------------- -----------

### Equipment Descriptions

**Quiver:** A light leather container with a strap made for carrying
arrows or bolts. Groups of 20 bolts or arrows usually come in a quiver.

**Sheath:** A simple leather container with a strap made for carrying a
single weapon; it can either be worn on a belt for one-handed type
weapons or across the back for larger two-handed weapons.

**Armor Padding:** This item comes with the purchase of Full Plate
armor.

**Cap (Steel):** This item comes with the purchase of a Chain Shirt.

**Helmet (Visored):** This item comes with the purchase of Full Plate
armor.

**Bracers of Armor +9 and +10:** These items function exactly like other
Bracers of Armor just at a +9 and +10 bonus. They are included here
because the MagicItemsV.rtf document details Bracers from +1 to +8 and
the Epic document details Bracers from +11 and higher. These two fill in
the gap.

### Starting Funds Kits

These kits will randomly grant an amount of gold, adding it to the
"Gold" field on the **Gear Tab** which can then be spent purchasing
equipment. There are several kits corresponding to the typical dice used
for this purpose. The **Starting Gold** kits can be applied as many
times as you wish and they will continue to add more gold to your PC.

Starting Funds (1d4 times 10)

Starting Funds (2d4 times 10)

Starting Funds (3d4 times 10)

Starting Funds (4d4 times 10)

Starting Funds (5d4 times 10)

Starting Funds (6d4 times 10)

<span id="pcgenogcpsicrystal"></span> PCGen OGC - Psicrystal Hit Dice Data Set
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Game Mode: 35e**

The PCGen Open Gaming Content - Psicrystal Hit Dice dataset is designed
to modify Psicrystals in the RSRD Psionics dataset so that they gain hit
dice as the Master progresses in class levels.

The need for this originates from certain interpretations of the
Psicrystal rules which hold that Psicrystals gain hit dice as the Master
progresses in class levels and by extension also gain feats every 3
levels and stat bumps every 4. The dataset was not coded in this way and
the designers apparently never intended this, however no errata has been
published to refute or clarify this interpretation. This set is provided
for those who wish to play Psicrystals under this interpretation.

This set must be loaded with the RSRD Psionics set or the RSRD Complete
set (which includes Psionics). When loaded it adds Hit Dice (Monster
Class Levels) equal to the masters Psionic class levels. It also adds a
point to the feat pool at first, third and every three levels after.
Every four levels it grants a 1 point increase to an attribute of the
user's choice.

**Note:** An unmodified Psicrystal is granted Alertness as a virtual
feat, this set disables that, Alertness must be purchased with a feat
point if it is desired.

### Additional Feature

The rules state that a Psicrystal has at least 4 Ranks in Spot, Listen,
Move Silently, and Search even if its Master does not. PCGen cannot
implement this automatically so 4 temporary bonuses can be activated
manually by the user to bring the ranks of these skills up to 4 if the
Master is lacking. They can be found in the Temporary Bonuses sub-tab of
the Inventory Tab under templates. Each starts with the name "Psicrystal
Skills" and allows you to set the Rank from 1 to 4.

**Game Mode: Default**

The 80 Point Standard Campaign point-buy-method is provided as part of
the default gameMode folder and so is made available if the selected
gameMode doesn't include a Point-Buy Method. The 80 point system assumes
initial stats are set to zero.
