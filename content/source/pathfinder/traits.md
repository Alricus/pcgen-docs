### Traits

This dataset is for a free web enhancement from Paizo which can be
[downloaded here](http://www.paizo.com/traits) . It details a number of
optional traits that can be added to a player character at creation.
When this dataset is loaded a new sub-tab under Feats and Abilities will
appear named "Traits". Because it is optional and is generally intended
for player characters (and not NPC's and Monsters) the Traits pool is
not automatically active for all characters. To activate the Traits pool
go to the Race tab and click the Templates sub-tab and add the template
named "Player Character" to your PC. This will add two points to the
Traits pool allowing you to make 2 selections. You can also manually add
and subtract from this pool by changing the number in the field below.
