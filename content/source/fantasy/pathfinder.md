### NPCs

A number of non-player characters from this source can be generated from
kits included in the dataset. Create a new character and click the Add
Kit/Create Monster button, in the list of kits you will find a set of
kits which starts with "NPC" followed by the name of the character in
parentheses. All the monsters introduced in this book can also be
generated with a Default Monster Kit as well.

Some characters are unique creations and required custom templates to
grant the abilities specified by the books authors. For example the
character Koruvus is a goblin which has been mutated by the Waters of
Lamashtu which made him medium size and give him the ability to spit
acid among other abilities. To account for this a template was created
named "Waters of Lamashtu (Koruvus's Mutation)" which if removed will
restore the character to a more normal goblin (which is a possible
outcome in the scenario).

Not all the NPC's are included because some were created using closed
content and cannot be recreated in PCGen.
