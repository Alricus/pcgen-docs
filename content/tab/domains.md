The **Domains** tab is where you select a **Deity** for your character.
PC's that have domains as a Class feature, Clerics as an example, will
select their domains on this tab.

![Main Tab: Domains](../images/tabs/domainstab/tab_domains_01.png)

The upper-left pane contains the list of available deities. Clicking on
one that the PC is qualified for and then clicking on the **Select**
button to select it. Once a deity is chosen the upper-right pane will be
populated with the domains available from the selected deity. The number
of domains the user can choose and the number of domains they have
chosen will be indicated.

When clicking on a deity the details about it will be displayed in the
lower-left window. Likewise, clicking on a domain will cause its details
to be displayed in the lower-right window.
