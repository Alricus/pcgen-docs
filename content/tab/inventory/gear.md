![Inventory Purchase
Sub-Tab](../../images/tabs/inventorytab/tab_inventory_00_purchase.png)

This sub-tab allows the purchasing and selling of armor, items, shields
and weapons.

The left pane includes items that can be bought or customized. The
"Available" drop-down menu lets you choose how to list the items.

The right pane includes the items your character currently has. If you
right-click any of the items there you will get the option to "Move To"
and "Copy To". Under each option there is a listing of all the other
currently-loaded characters. You can then either move the item (sending
the selected item to the selected character and removing it from the
current character's list of equipment) or copy it (send a copy of the
item to the selected character).

The "Order" column dictates the order the items get output to the
character output sheet (only equipped items get output to the output
sheets).

Items can be purchased by:

-   Selecting the item in the left frame and then clicking the
    "&gt;" (Add) button
-   Selecting the item in the left frame and then pressing
    **Ctrl&gt;&lt;=&gt;**
-   Double Clicking the item in the left frame
-   Right clicking the item in the left frame and buying 1, 5, 10, 20 or
    n (user entered quantity) at a time

As you purchase items you will see the amount of money you have
available in the lower right frame diminishes. The amount deducted is
the price multiplied by the **Buy Percentage**

Items can be sold by:

-   Selecting the item in the right frame and then clicking the
    "&lt;" (Remove) button
-   Selecting the item in the right frame and then pressing
    **Ctrl&gt;&lt;-&gt;**
-   Double Clicking the item in the right frame
-   Right clicking the item in the right frame and selling 1, 5, 10, 20
    or n (user entered quantity) at a time

As you sell items you will see the amount of money you have available in
the lower right frame increases. The amount added is the price
multiplied by the **Sell Percentage**

You can modify this total by editing the **Gold:** field.

The **Allow Debt** option enables PCGen to allow negative gold amounts
to represent what the Character owes.

The **Ignore Cost** option allows items to be added or removed without
effecting the gold value.

Pressing **&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;f&gt;** or using the right click menu's
**Find item** option allows for searching for items. The nearest match
in the item list will be highlighted.

The charges a wand or similar item has left can be modified after
purchasing the item by right clicking it in the right window and
choosing **Modify Charges** .

PC), right click on it and choose **Create custom item** .

**Note:** The item needs to be "Masterwork" if a magical item is to be
created.

To add new properties to the item, select them from the left hand pane
and either double click or click the **Add** button. If the Property
prerequisites are not met, it is shown in the default error color and it
cannot be added.

Other than properties, the following can be modified:

-   **Name** - The name that will be displayed in the item list
-   **Sprop** - Any special properties that the item has
-   **Cost** - The purchase cost of the item
-   **Weight** - The weight of the item

Once all properties have been selected, you can either choose **OK** to
add it to the item list or **Buy** to add it to the item list and add it
to the characters possessions
