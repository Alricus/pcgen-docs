![Inventory Equipping
Sub-Tab](../../../images/tabs/inventory_equipping.png)

This Sub-tab allows the Gear that was purchased to be equipped. It also
allows the creation of multiple equipment sets so you can print output
sheets based on different weapon, armor and item combinations for your
character.

Select locations for the items your character owns on the upper right
frame.

Armors, shields, and magical items need to be marked as "Equipped" so
that PCGen gives you the appropriate benefit for using them.

Weapons can be equipped as Single Handed, Two Handed and Both Hands. The
equipped style determines what bonuses/penalties apply. Weapons that are
carried will appear on the character sheet in the weapons section.

Some items are containers and can hold other items.

Every item your character is carrying should be marked "Carried" so your
encumbrance will be figured correctly.

You can add additional equipment sets by typing in the name of an
equipment set and clicking on the Add button (in the Upper right hand
frame).

You can then select equipment from the left hand frame (this contains
what you bought in the gear tab) into the equipment sets you chose (e.g.
Dungeon, City etc). You can do this by selecting an item and double
clicking on it or clicking on the **Add** ("&gt;") button.
