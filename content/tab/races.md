The **Races** tab is where you select your race.

![Main Tab: Races](../images/tabs/racestab/tab_race_00.png)

The left pane displays the full list of races available from the loaded
data sets. Besides PC races, this list also includes all monster races.
Clicking on the **No Racial HD** button will remove all races that have
inherent hit dice. Clicking on the **Qualified** button will remove all
races that have requirements that the current character does not meet.
An example of this would be a race with an alignment requirement.
Finally, you can use the **Search** field to find the race you are
looking for.

The right pane is where the character's race appears once its been
selected. If the race was selected from the **Summary** tab the race
selected will already be listed here. In that case, if you continue and
select another race, as each character can only have one race, the
previous race will be replaced with the new one.

The lower pane is the **Race Info** pane. When you select a race in the
left or right pane this pane will display the basic information for the
selected race.

Selecting a race is a simple process. Find and click on the desired race
in the left pane and then click on the **Select Race &gt;** button. The
race appears in the right pane and you are done.

If you wish to change the selected race you will select the race lisrted
in the right pane and then click on the **&lt; Unselect Race** button.
The race will be removed from the right pane. Now you can proceed to
select a new race.
