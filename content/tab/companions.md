This tab allows animal companions, familiars, followers and mounts,
including special mounts, to be created, added, modified and deleted
from the character. For animal companions, familiars, and special mounts
to show up, your character has to be of a class that allows those
companions (e.g. Druid, Wizard, or Paladin respectively).
