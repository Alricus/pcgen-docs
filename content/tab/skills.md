This is the **Skill** tab where the user selects what skills from the
list of skills loaded from the sources that were chosen when first
starting PCGen.

![Main Tab: Skills](../images/tabs/skillstab/tab_skills_00.png)

The table in the top left displays the name of the Skill, the total
skill bonus, the skill modifier, the ranks taken by the character, and
whether the skill is a class skill or not.

The table at the top right displays all the skills along with useful
bits of information about them such as:

-   **Skill**
-   **Key Ability**
-   **Total Skill Bonus**
-   **Ability Modifier**
-   **Ranks**
-   **Miscelaneous Modifiers**

A **Cost** of 0 means that you cannot purchase this skill unless in the
**Options** tab a non-zero cost to these exclusive skills (usually the
value is 4 or higher) were assigned.

Once the skill has been selected, right click on the Skill and select
any of the following:

-   **Add 1** - adds one skill point to the Skill
-   **Add 5** - adds five skill points to the Skill
-   **Add 10** - adds ten skill points to the Skill
-   **Add n** - allows the user to input a number instead of selecting
    one of the choices
-   **Max Ranks** - assigns the maximum number of skill points to the
    Skill that is possible for that PC

The bottom right hand window displays skill information on the PC.

-   The **Max class skill rank** number shows the maximum amount of
    skill ranks possible with the current PC
-   The **Max Cross-class skill rank** shows the maximum cross-class
    skill ranks allowed

The **Include** drop down menu allows the user to select what types of
other Skills to display:

-   **None** - only class and cross-class skills with ranks are
    displayed
-   **Untrained** - displays all untrained Skills as well as class and
    cross-class skills with ranks
-   **All** - displays all Skills from the source material regardless of
    it's usability

**Total Skill points left** is the number of Skill points left to be
chosen by the user to add Skill points to the PC. When this number
reaches 0, no more skill points are left to be added for the PC.

**Skill points left for class** drop down menu displays how many Skill
points are available for each class that the PC has. If the PC has
multiple classes than the drop down menu allows the user to choose which
class to add appropriate Skill points for.
