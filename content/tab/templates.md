Templates are generally meant to handle "permanent" adjustments and not
situational ones. Examples of these are the **Advanced Creature**
template from the RSRD and the Pathfinder core rules.

![Main Tab: Template](../images/tabs/templatestab/tab_template_00.png)

The left pane displays the full list of templates available from the
loaded data sets. Clicking on the **Qualified** button will remove all
templates that have requirements that the current character does not
meet. An example of one of these would be a race with an alignment
requirement such as **Trained Animal** which requires, per the
Pathfinder Core Rules, that the creature upon which it is applied must
be an **Animal** with an intelligence of less than 3. Finally, you can
use the **Search** field to find the template you are looking for.

The right pane is where templates applied to the character appear,
whether newly applied or applied previously. once its been selected.

The lower pane is the **Template Info** pane. When you select a template
in the left or right pane this pane will display the basic information
for the selected template.

Selecting a template is a simple process. Find and click on the desired
template in the left pane and then click on the **Add Template &gt;**
button. The template appears in the right pane and you are done.

If you wish to remove any applied templates, and assuming that the
template is removable, you simply select the template listed in the
right pane that is to be removed and click on the **&lt; Remove
Template** button. The template will be removed from the character and
from the right pane.
