The left pane of this tab lists a number of notes where additional
information on the current character can be stored. There are a umber of
standard notes provided by PCGen.

The **Detail** note is where the height, weight, age, etc. are detailed.
Each piece of detail has a checkbox next to it. You can export this
information to the Character sheet by clicking on the adjacent checkbox.
Clicking the **All** button at the top of the **Detail** note will
export all detail included on the page to the character sheet. Clicking
the **None** button will prohibit all of the date from being exported.
