The **Class** tab is where you add class levels to your characters.

![Main Tab: Classes](../images/tabs/classestab/tab_classes_00.png)

The left pane displays the full list of classes available from the
loaded data sets. Besides PC classes, this list also includes all NPC
and Creature classes. Clicking on the **Qualified** button will remove
all classes that have requirements that the current character does not
meet. An example of this would be a class with an alignment requirement,
such as the **Paladin** which requires that the character be "Lawful
Good". Finally, you can use the **Search** field to find the class you
are looking for.

The right pane is where the character's classes appear as they are
added. All classes previously selected, from this tab or from the
**Summary** tab, will already be listed here. In this case, if you
continue and select another class, either the same of a new class, the
newly selected class will be added to the list.

The lower pane is the **Class Info** pane. When you select a class in
the left or right pane this pane will display the basic information for
the selected class.

Selecting a class is a simple process. Find and click on the desired
class in the left pane and then click on the **Add Level(s) &gt;**
button. The class appears in the right pane, at the bottom of the list,
and you are done.

If you wish to remove a class level you click on the **&lt; Remove
Level** button. The last class added will be removed from the character
and from the right pane.
