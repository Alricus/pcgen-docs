1.  <span class="underline"> Why can't I make a (insert Prestige Class
    Name here)? </span>

    Well I know you are all keen to play the (insert Prestige Class Name
    here), so here goes:

    Make sure you have chosen **all** the prerequisites. Not just some
    of them. This may include needing levels in a particular class,
    ranks in certain skills, a particular feat, particular spells in
    your spell book and more.

    You can check how you are doing by clicking on the class (in the
    Classes Tab) you want to get to, in the bottom left hand corner it
    will show you the class and what pre-reqs you are missing (in red)

2.  <span class="underline"> Why isn't my character proficient with
    (insert Weapon Name here)? </span>

    Are you sure you've fulfilled **all** the prerequisites for this
    weapon?

    If you have, on the summary tab, try clicking the 'Abilities' button
    then the "Weapon Profs" and select the proficiency.

3.  <span class="underline"> Why can I not add bonus languages to my
    character? </span>

    According to the rules a first level character can choose a number
    of bonus languages equal to his intelligence bonus. A character may
    not choose bonus languages after first level. As a house rule
    [PCGen's preferences](/menu/settings/character/house-rules.html) can
    be set to allow one to choose bonus languages after first level.

4.  <span class="underline"> Why can I not add all the spells I should
    know at level (X) </span>

    PCGen will allow you to add lower level spells to higher level slots
    (per the rules) but this will prevent you from fully populating
    these slots with spells of the highest level which could go in them.
    For example, if your character can cast three 0-level spells and one
    1st level spell per day it is possible to add four 0-level spells to
    your spell list because you are using the first level slot to hold a
    0-level spell. This will prevent you from adding a first level spell
    to your list. An easy way to avoid this situation is to add you
    highest level spells first and work your way down.

5.  <span class="underline"> Why does the ex-monk not work correctly?
    </span>

    Well basically supporting ex-classes and removing levels is a very
    difficult task.

    We at every release improve this functionality, but the whole issue
    probably won't be cleanly resolved until we head down the CDOM path
    (in the medium term future).

6.  <span class="underline"> Why are there no Feat/Skill-description?
    </span>

    This is done to prevent anyone from being able to use PCGen to
    bypass purchasing books. Feats that come from sources that don't
    have one-line descriptions have similar descriptions created
    for them.

    For special abilities from classes, PCGen has the name of the
    ability from the class level table in the source book although if
    someone adds in \#/day or some such that isn't in there, that's not
    a big deal.

    If you want more description than this, you'll have to make your own
    version of the files, because this is the word of the PCGen Team and
    it will go a long way to avoiding publishers breathing down people's
    necks about this whole thing.

    Needless to say we do <span class="underline"> **NOT** </span>
    endorse or encourage people to start swapping fully descriptive
    text files.

    **It is important to note that publishers are our friends! A vast
    majority have supported this, so we're going to play nice and so
    should you.**

    If you don't play nice we send the Ninja Monkeys
    after you...........
