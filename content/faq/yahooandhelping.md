1.  <span class="underline"> The Yahoo Message Boards </span>

    Go to <http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/>

    Here there are 5000+ users to help you, good eh! Post whatever PCGen
    related questions, comments etc you have (but please report bugs and
    feature requests as described below). Very, very rarely does a post
    go unnoticed, in fact you will be overwhelmed with help most of
    the time. Please be aware that post to the yahoo groups gains you
    the attention of Karianna, s/he may or may not decide to take you
    soul, your risk.

    If you for some reason cannot get access to Yahoo or are really
    struggling, contact David R. Bender (Papa\_DRB), he's the moderator.

    In addition to the main group there are a few other Yahoo groups
    devoted to the more arcane aspects of PCGen. They are:

    [PCGen
    Experimental](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental/) -
    Devoted to developing new data sources and LST tag syntax.

    [List File Help](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PCGenListFileHelp/) -
    The place to go for advice and help coding your own custom
    LST files.

    [LST File Class](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LSTfileclass/) - An
    instructional group with posts detailing step by step procedures for
    writing data files.

    [PCGen
    International](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_international/) -
    Devoted to translating PCGen.

2.  <span class="underline"> Why are my messages in the yahoo groups
    board being ignored? </span>

    This happens pretty rarely, but probably because we are busy
    eating bananas.

    How long is it since you posted this message? The message-board
    receive many, many mails a day. Because of this, many users choose
    to receive the digest version of the mails. This slows things down.
    An other reason might be that your question is answered either in
    this FAQ or in one of the many html-files in the documentation-files
    included in PCGen. Check those, and then, if you still get nowhere,
    post again, with the legend REPOST somewhere in your heading. Of
    course, you might have hit upon something that no-one has thought
    of, and everyone is right now hacking away at their computers and
    PCGen to solve your problem, in any case, be patient.

3.  <span class="underline"> Working with issues and Tracker Monkeys.
    </span>

    A lot of work is done through the Yahoo Group and because of the
    large volume of traffic your message might easily be overlooked by
    the person or team you are trying to reach. Adding certain tags to
    the subjects of your posts helps the monkeys filter through the
    noise and catch the posts relevant to their area of expertise. The
    Tracker Monkeys are the link between all the teams and the community
    at large and are usually the ones to contact with questions, bug
    reports and feature requests.

    If you want to get the attention of a tracker monkey, please put
    '\[TM\]' in your subject line. If you think it is a bug, put
    '\[BUG\]'; a freq, '\[FREQ\]'; it relates to code, '\[CODE\]';
    data, '\[DATA\]'; output sheets, '\[OS\]'.

    If you enter a issue off of a request made on any of the boards,
    please put '\[trackered\]' in the reply subject, with the issue
    number and URL of the issue. This is to cut down on the
    duplicating efforts. For example, if you see a string of issue
    requests and a '\[trackered\]' with them, you know that someone has
    entered the issue already.

    For more information on issues see the [Submitting a Bug
    Report](/faq/bug-report.html) and [Submitting a Feature
    Request](/faq/feature-request.html) pages.

4.  <span class="underline"> I want to help! </span>

    Well of course you do! OK, there are a vast variety of ways in which
    you can help us here at PCGen. We can use:

    -   JAVA Coders (Code Monkeys)
    -   LST file editors (Data Monkeys)
    -   Admin Monkeys
    -   Documenters (Doc Monkeys)
    -   Public Relations (PR Monkeys)
    -   Checking Licensing (Data License Monkeys)
    -   **Anybody who wants to, no matter your level of experience!**

    We could go into vast detail here on how you could help in any
    particular section. But the way to join is posting a message to
    Yahoo with the title:\
    \
     "I WANT TO HELP"\
    \
     Someone will claim your soul shortly afterwards and help you
    offline on how to go about doing things.

    Needless to say, this is one of the most fun and rewarding
    communities you can join! PCGen is about **FUN** , just read an
    average day of the message boards and you'll see what I mean!

    See [Monkey Teams Explained](/faq/monkey-teams-explained.html) for
    details on the various PCGen teams.

5.  <span class="underline"> How do I submit list files from official
    RPG products? </span>

    Well, if you've made the list files, and want them to be checked out
    by everyone to see their worthiness, then you can post them in a zip
    file to:\
    \
    <http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental/files/>

    Choose an appropriate sub folder, contact the Content Silverback if
    you can't decide.

    Once everyone has gone over them, or you feel they are ready to be
    included in the alpha/beta releases of PCGen, then Post a message to
    the yahoo group <http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen_experimental>
    with the subject line reading "TRACKER MONKEYS PLEASE PUT THESE
    FILES INTO THE TRACKER SYSTEM" and the Files will disappear from the
    Yahoo Files Section and 'auto-magically' appear in the PCGen issue
    tracking system.

    If they pass the List Monkeys tests, then they get included into the
    Alpha/Beta builds, if not, they will get kicked back to the Tracker
    with a note for the Tracker Monkeys to notify you.

6.  <span class="underline"> I've finished the list files, but I don't
    know if I should put them in the yahoo group yet, as I haven't
    contacted the Publisher for permission, what do I do? </span>

    Check the [Publisher Permissions
    list](/credits/publishers-and-sources.html) in this document for the
    list of publishers that have given us permission to include
    their stuff.

    If you are unsure of who to contact, or are unsure or know you suck
    at people skills, you can leave a txt file in the zip stating that
    you did not contact anyone. If you do contact the publisher for
    permission, please make the txt file in the zip with who you
    contacted and what their response was. copies of the email exchanges
    are highly recommended. At the very minimum, include who you
    exchanged email with, what date it was, and what their response was.

7.  <span class="underline"> I've Converted a 1st/2nd Ed Source
    Material, can we include those in the releases? </span>

    The short answer is no. Unless a 1st/2nd Ed product has been
    officially converted into 3ed rules and you have permission from the
    publisher, we can't include them.

8.  <span class="underline"> I've created my own custom campaign world,
    can I include that in the releases? </span>

    The short answer is again no. You can however, if you wish to share
    you're work, post them here in zip format:\
    [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/files/Campaign%2BCentral/UnOfficial%20%26%20Converted%20Source%20Material/](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen/files/Campaign+Central/UnOfficial%20&%20Converted%20Source%20Material/)\
     for others on the yahoo group to share.
