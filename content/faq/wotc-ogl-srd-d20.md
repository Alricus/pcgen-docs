    When 3rd edition came out in 2000, Wizards of the Coast (WotC) also
    created the [Open Gaming
    License (OGL)](http://www.wizards.com/d20/files/OGLv1.0a.rtf) . This
    would allow 3rd party publishers to use Open Game Content (OGC) as
    long as they followed the rules laid out in the OGL. WotC took most,
    but not all, of the material in the PHB, DMG and MM and created the
    System Reference Document (SRD). They declared this to be OGC, which
    is what the 3rd party publishers initially used. At a later date,
    WotC added material from the Psionics Handbook to the SRD.

    When d20 Modern came out, WotC created the Modern [System Reference
    Document (MSRD)](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=d20/article/msrd) .
    This contains material from d20 Modern, d20 Future, Menace Manual
    and Urban Arcana.

    When 3.5 came out, WotC created the [Revised System Reference
    Document (RSRD)](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=d20/article/srd35) .
    This contains material from the 3.5 PHB, 3.5 DMG, 3.5 MM, Expanded
    Psionics Handbook, Deities and Demigods (not everything in this
    material was converted to 3.5), Epic Level Handbook (as Deities
    and Demigods) and a little bit from Manual of the Planes.

    Any material that WotC did not place in the various Reference
    Documents is not available for 3rd party publishers to use. The Red
    Wizard of Thay did not make it into the RSRD, so PCGen can not
    include that in our distribution.
