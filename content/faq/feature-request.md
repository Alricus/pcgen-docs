The purpose of this document is to provide a walk through of how to
properly submit a feature request at Source Forge for PCGen. Please read
the [Bug vs. Feature](/faq/bug-report.html) to make sure that what you
want to submit is a feature request.

Before you attempt to submit a feature request, visit the PCGen Yahoo
Group message boards ( <http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen> ), and
describe your feature request. Feature Requests are often referred to as
FREQs on the board. This way others can help you refine the request or
tell you that it's already been entered as a FREQ or even point out that
the FREQ would be useful for another book as well. Once the FREQ has
been kicked about and refined you can then submit it.
